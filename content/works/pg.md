<h4>Tools Used: Photoshop, Illustrator, and Sketch</h4>

<p>
  Brief: Unlike other industries such as yoga and gymnastics (plus many others); there's no agreed-upon names for moves for pole dancing. I personally was tired of endlessly scrolling through my phone, wasting valuable (and expensive) class time looking for a certain new move to learn. So, I came up with a way to keep all the pole moves in one place with an easy way to search/favourite images and contracted Danitt to do the initial design and build.</p>
<p>
    The photos needed to be illustrated to avoid any issues. The first few thousand images were illustrated by an outsourced designer which was expensive. So, I learned Photoshop and Illustrator so I can do it myself. Thus far, I have illustrated over 600 hundred images and costumes.
</p>

<p>
    Furthermore, I re-designed the app for a fresh new look and updated the logo with a clean and minimalist design.
