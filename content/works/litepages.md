  LitePages is an all in one back-end business platform. They take care of everything so the tradies and small businesses can do what they do best. I was the front-end engineer and therefore responsible for building & maintaining the front-end for a customer-facing HR & advertising platform, including porting the project to the Vue JS framework, and actively collaborating with the in-house UI/UX team for feature development.

    I helped build the portal where tradies and small business can sign up to the platform. At first, it wqas writting in Pug and we kept it alive for a while as there was paying customers on it. However, we came to the conclusion that we needed to migrate it over it to Nuxt due to security and better user experience.

    We also decided to migrate our WordPress site over to Vue as well. Make everything in the same environment for ease of maintenance and better overall user experience. Plus, we wanted to build some custom features that WordPress was having difficulty in adding.
