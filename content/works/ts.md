  <p>
    Jo from “Two Sheds Workshop for Women” wanted an updated website that informs her current students of upcoming events, classes, changes to timetable, and handle class bookings. The project started off in a team environment but as the tasks grew smaller and near completion, I became the sole person working on it.

    I've never met Jo in person, this website was created while I was in Europe. We communicated via email and sometimes Skype to get to project done. Furthermore, I provided documentation so she can manage the site herself but I still offer tech support from time to time.
