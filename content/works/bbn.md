  Brief: Client owns a silent auction site where customers can sell their second-hand items to try and get the best deal. The seller adds their own price to the item and customers come in and make bids. The client
  wanted to streamline the bidding process - from paper forms to an app. Bidders download the app, enter the information/QR Code scan and submit bids. This connects to the online system which collects all the bids at the end of the week, coallating all the data and sending out the relevant information to winners and sellers. The app greatly minimised human error and created efficiency for the business overall.

  Below are some of the mockups of the login screen. I had free reign on the design but I used the colours from the logo and staff portal.
