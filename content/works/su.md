  Brief: A staff portal was developed by Danitt before I joined the team. It was a way for Ride It Right to manage their motorcycle fleet of voer 150 bikes at 6 different training centres along the East Coast. It was also a way for staff to communicate and check their roster. RIR was in the process of upgrading the system but they closed due to unforseen circumstances.

<p>
  A new contract was established with Stay Upright. They needed a few modifications to the Portal and the addition of their branding. I took over the new designs and client communications. Together, we came up with new features that further enhanced their business. Furthermore, I occassionally fly to their head office in Sydney for staff training on how to use the Portal and discuss possible new features. I also created staff training videos for the ocassional new staff member.
