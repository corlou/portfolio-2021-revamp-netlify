    Currently, my professional experience has given me a lot of work in designing digital pieces. Though, some areas such as print are slightly lacking. Below are samples of various works to demonstrate my skill expansion.

        <p>Here are some event posters I designed in Illustrator in CMYK with a 3mm bleed and intending to be printed on a high gloss poster for “The Fancy Place” event and textured paper for “The Tea Room”.</p>

      <p>I felt that the Danitt business card needed a fresh, new, and minimalistic look. Below are samples of the old and new designs.</p>

        <p>PoleGuide started off as an app but now I’m branching out into other avenues. Currently, everyone else is selling pole clothing so I want to focus on pole accessories. There is a market for it but the place with the most pole dancing accessories has terrible customer service and many PayPal disputes. Something I can certainly learn from.</p>
        <p>There's a trend in the pole world for Unicorns, Mermaids, and Fairies. So my first three shirt designs were of those. Below is a sample of my Pole Mermaid shirt design. I deliberately picked a stock photo of a female with red hair as a nod to the most famous mermaid Ariel. I also got some socks printed. Everyone else does shirts that say "Point your Toes" but no one has socks. It seems like a better reminder plus the lines are there to tell if your feet are straight. I have made a few sales on this e-commerce store.</p>

      <h5>MailChimp and Social Media</h5>
        <p>
          Staying in contact with customers and encouraging them to return to your products/website is vital for any business. I recently set up a MailChimp account and began an email campaign to inform pole studios in Australia about PoleGide. I included a discount for the shop because they need to know what's in it for them. Futhermore, I manage a Facebook, Instagram, and Pinterest accounts which feature a "Move of the Week" in order to reach a larger audience.
