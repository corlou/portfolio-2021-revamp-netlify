  Brief: I was scrolling through the Instagram page I manage for PoleGuide and came across someone wanting a logo for their pole fitness group. I sent them a message, letting them know that my skills were available. They didn't have much budget and a general rule for design is "either do it for full price or do it for free". So, I did this one for free.
