    New skills: scrum master, mentor, conducting inductions, online magazine creation, journalism, hiring/firing of interns, training, interviewing candidates for intern positions, photography, and creative leader.  I started the unpaid internship in August 2018 and it finished in October 2018. During my time there I gained a variety of skills while refining some current ones and dusting off old ones.

<h5>WordPress</h5> <!--JKA website -->
<p>
    When I first came on board, there was a basic WordPress website up for JKA and it was my job to revamp it. Below is an example of the home page and the team page.</p>

<h5>Logo for Yoga Business</h5> <!--Logo Design -->
    <p>
        It appeared that we were going to have a lot of clients needing WordPress sites therefore, I set up the True Blue Yoga website and supervised another intern putting it together. I did, however, have a hand in creating their logo as seen below.

<h5>Logo for Online Magazine</h5> <!--Magazine Logo Design -->
    <p>
        This is the logo I designed for the online magazine “Living Lifestyles” (of which I was also the journalist and editor). Here are the three iterations of the logo, the final one being number 3.

<h5>Online Magazine Editor</h5> <!--Magazine Editor -->
    <p>
        I was the editor and one of the journalists for the first issue of Living Lifestyles magazine. It was my job to sign off on the colour palette, cover, layout, and editing of the articles. Here is the PDF copy of the magazine - it was published using the website Issuu but I have embedded it here for my own records.

<h5>Other Tasks</h5> <!--Other Tasks -->
    <p>
       During my time at JKA, I was also a mentor for the other graphic designers. We discussed design elements, strategies, and resources that we needed to get the job done. The times when the boss was out of the office, I lead the stand up meeting as scrum master and delegated tasks to each person based on their skills and expertise. sat in on the hiring of interns, coming up with some of the interview questions and providing advice/opinion of the candidate to the director of JKA. If the candidate was successful, I ran the induction made sure they filled in the required paperwork. I was also part of the firing of interns as either a witness or asking some questions. It was hard work and I learned a lot but there was no permanent position available.
