  Dank uwel = Thank you

  We came here because of the film “In Bruges” and wanted to see if it really was “like a f*%kin fairytale”.
</p>

<p>
  It certainly delivered. Over Christmas and New Years there were markets and waffles everywhere. Bruges at Christmas time really was something special.
</p>

<p>
  If you do go on a tour of the city to see the film sites of “In Bruges” don’t mention it to the people you are visiting. Some don’t like to be reminded of the film or the constant annoying questions they must get. So just quietly enjoy it for what it is.
</p>

<p>
  People speak a variety of languages here (average person speaks 3!). Again, it’s polite to learn a few words/phrases.
</p>

<p>
  Rent or buy a bicycle. Everything is flat and there are lots of places to chain it up while exploring the city. Renewable energy is big here and bike riding is encouraged.
</p>

<p>
  Our Airbnb host was loads of fun and we shared stories of our travels over Belgium beers and made plans to attend Burning Man.
