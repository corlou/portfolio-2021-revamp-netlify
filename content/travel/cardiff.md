    Sometime mid-2016 I decided to quit teaching.  I had spent a total of 5 years in the industry and had grown dissatisfied with it. So, the day after I quit, I chopped off more of my hair and went blue (a small rebellious phase I think).

    Cardiff marks the start of me transitioning into the world of IT. This was also our first ever AirBnb experience.  Not a great one but not a deterrent. The contracts were with Australian clients which meant I had to transition over to working Australian hours. You got it; work through the night, travel/explore, sleep then work again. I was to become a night owl.

    We went specifically to Cardiff to see “The Doctor Who Experience“. Pay extra for the adventure option where you get to tag along with the Doctor. It’s kinda cheesy but worth it. You can also take a one hour (approx.) train ride to “Bad Wolf Bay” where Rose and the Doctor had their… moment (no spoilers here).

    Dan and I haven’t seen Cardiff at any other time during the year but when we went in October, everything was covered in gold, yellow, orange and red leaves. It was very beautiful. Definitely go for a walk in the parks.  There are a few nice coffee shops around and Dan decided to give green tea latte try (shudder). I will stick to chai thanks.
