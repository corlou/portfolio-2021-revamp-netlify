    Another fun stop on the way to Copenhagen. By now my husband had signed up for an IT conference in Denmark and we were looking for places to kill time.

  <p>
    We stayed in a hotel for a few days while our AirBnb host was coming back from her trip. Staying with hosts has many benefits. You get to see the city like a local and find off the beaten track things to do. At this point in our trip, we wanted those experiences.

    So, off to ice swimming we went. The water was a nice 3-4 degrees celsius and we had to walk barefoot across snow to get to the water. I promised myself that I only had to do it once and then I was out and into the sauna.  Nope. I went agian in Poland.

    I also took a Lyra class in this town. It was nice getting some exercise in and the teacher spoke Danish and English very well. We were here for the briefest of times so I didnâ€™t learn any of the language. However, my husband gave it a good shot and I would have to say that Danish was the hardest language I have come across (for now). All part of the fun of travelling.
