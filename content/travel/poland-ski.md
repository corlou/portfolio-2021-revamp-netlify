    We all trooped on down to the ski fields in Piwniczna, Poland and spent some time skiing, work and general family time.

    “Fat Thursday” is a Polish tradition where you eat as many doughnuts as you can to bring luck for the year. It falls on the last Thursday before Ash Wednesday and so we stuffed ourselves. It was great and I feel pretty lucky now. I don't want to see another doughnut for a while though.

    There was a lot of ski fields to chose from but I stayed with the easy ones. Those mountains looked intimidating! I like skiing and I hope to get good enough that I can listen to music while going down the slopes.
