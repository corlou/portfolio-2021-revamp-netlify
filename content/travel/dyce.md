    After getting back from the Shetlands, we stayed in Dyce for a little while. We didnâ€™t do a lot of exploring as work was piling up and I was still working on switching over to working at night.

    However, it is worth noting that by this stage, we were out of suitcases and down to backpacks. We donated a lot of clothes and the suitcases themselves to charity. There was a Black Friday Sale on at all shops so we each bought a new backpack and trainers.

    Wow! What a great investment. The trainers are North Face Hedgehogs with Gore-Tex lining (perfect for tracking through snow) and my backpack can hold around 15kgs. I did have to check airlines and their carry on policy before booking flights but it was worth it.
