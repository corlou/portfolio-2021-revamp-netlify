  By now our sleep schedule was all over the place: torn between work, sleep and play. I was averaging between 3-4 hours of sleep per day and Dan was roughly the same.

<p>
  We went skiing in Cortina dâ€™Ampezzo and we were blessed with beautiful snowfalls and great skiing conditions.  The food was also lovely and speaking Italian was becoming easier.
</p>

<p>
  There were so many different skiing trails that it was next to impossible to do the same track twice.  It was also very easy to find the nearest bar for a Bombardino.
