    It’s a LOT smaller than what you expect but being one of the ancient wonders of the world, it’s still worth going.

    We all left early in the morning to avoid the crowds and so we would get back before dark. This worked out quite well but we still had to buy tickets and wait a while. When we finished looking around (probably about lunch time) and were at the gift shop, the place was packed with people buying tickets to view the stones.

    Furthermore, I would recommend getting the tape tour. I didn’t as I wanted to just see and appreciate the site but may have missed out on some fun facts.

    You can either get the bus up to the Stones or you can walk. They try and get as many people onto the shuttle buses so be prepared to get cosy.

    Also, buy the strawberries on the side of the road.  They were sweet and tasty.
