  Since we spent around three months here; these are some of the highlights.
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Went swimming in winter – there was a section of the lake where we could swim. The rest was frozen over.</li>
  <li>Had a Polish Card interview for immigration</li>
  <li>Warsaw Social (a variety of free weekly events)*</li>
  <li>Loads of IT conferences and workshops</li>
  <li>“The Invisible Exhibition” – a very humbling experience (a must do!)</li>
  <li>Bouldering and pole dancing</li>
  <li>Neon Museum (small but great history)</li>
  <li>Visit Old Town</li>
  <li>Try their national foods (berry pierogi is my favourite)</li>
  <li>Gave Uber Eats a whirl (that can be dangerous for us IT folk)</li>
  <li>Tried out for “House Hunters” tv show</li>
  <li>Rented the Veturilo bikes and took a ride around Warsaw’s many parks**</li>
  <li>Went to an indoor trampoline park where I did a backflip. Surprised of my success, I did another and crashed. Not fun!</li>
</ul>

<p>
  *Warsaw Social hosts an average of five free events every week. It’s a great way to meet new people, gain new skills, explore the city, practice the language, and just have an overall fabulous time. Don’t forget to contribute some coin so it can keep running.

  **working out the bicycles with Veturilo was a little difficult at first. You need to register online and pay the 10zł for the account fee and they will text you a password. Once you get to the bike station, enter your phone number (the one used for the online account) and the password. Enter the number of the bike you want. You will be given a code on the screen. Enter that code on the bike lock and away you go!
</p>

<p>
  It’s really easy to make friends here. Everyone is so nice and being a major city, a lot of people speak English really well. I have learned a few Polish phrases to get me through the day and the locals really appreciate me trying . I have found though, some are more than eager to try out their English speaking skills.
