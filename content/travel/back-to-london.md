    We went back to jolly ol’ England for a friend’s wedding. Finding a dress was difficult – the shoes in my bag had to match as I was out of room (again!). Flats and a maxi dress paired really well in the warmer weather and I had no issue rolling up the dress to fit in my bag.

    My father-in-law and I went to see the changing of the guard at Buckingham Palace and despite arriving part way through, we were still able to see most of what was happening. After that, we walked across Tower Bridge but had no desire to see the exhibition. I also finally got to make use of the Oyster card and found it really easy.  Just remember to swipe upon leaving the station.

    The wedding was beautiful but Dan and I were absolutely wrecked with staying up all night working and socialising during hte day. It was hard but we pushed through. The most endearing part of the wedding was when the groom said ” I am so lucky to be with her and I genuinely feel sorry for the rest of you because you can’t be with her.” Aw!

    We got on a red double decker bus between the ceremony and the reception so that was a first for me. It was a very British feeling.

    Now it’s time to head back to Newcastle, Australia then off to Brisbane!
