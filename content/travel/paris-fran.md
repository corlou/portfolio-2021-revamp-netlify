<p>
  Mum was missing dad and I hadn’t seen him in a very long time (almost a year). So he flew over and they both stayed with us in Sevenoaks. They rented a car and did some exploring of their own but it was decided that we all go to Paris.
</p>

<p>
  We went in September, just after the tourist season so everything was easy to see/experience.
</p>

<p>
  The Eiffel Tower was everything I dreamed it would be. It’s pretty majestic during the day but at night is truly spectacular. We were having dinner and suddenly mum said “Corina, look”. I looked up between the buildings and saw the Eiffel Tower lit up and sparkling. I can’t describe how I felt.
</p>

<p>
  I really enjoyed The Louvre too. Again, get there early to beat the crowds, we got there right on opening time and the line wasn’t too bad. People say that “The Mona Lisa” is small and overrated. I think if you have an open mind, it’s worth going to see.
</p>

<p>
  Notre Dame was also beautiful and a must-see. Didn’t go up the bell tower as the line was HUGE but inside was stunning. It was difficult taking pictures on my phone as it was quite dark inside.
