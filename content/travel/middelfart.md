    We were on our way to Copenhagen but wanted to make a stop along the way. Middelfart sounded like a great place.

    Work was getting busy again so we didn’t do a lot of exploring. It was nice place though. A good breather between major cities to catch up on work and sleep.

    I did buy a pair of “easy pants” to lounge around the house. My bag was getting fuller so it was almost time to do a cull. Yes, you can do a cull with only 12kg’s of luggage.

    People spoke English quite well here too but Danish was the main language. I gave it a go but my brain was a little overwhelmed with learning all these new languages for such a short amount of time spent in each place. I had also successfully transitioned over to working at night and completed some tasks for Danitt.  It’s official, I am working in IT!
