    This was a big trip and to cover everything will make this post huge.  So here are the highlights:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>My in-laws came to visit</li>
    <li>Two friends joined us on most of the trip</li>
    <li>Went to Malbork Castle and did a tour</li>
    <li>Visited the Salt Mines in south Poland (really fun experience and great beauty products)</li>
    <li>Was in Kraków for World Youth Day (absolutely packed with people from all over the world and roads blocked off all week)</li>
    <li>Travelled to Hel for a swim (so I can say “I went to Hel and back” or “I went swimming in Hel” NOTE: there were heaps of jellyfish but they don’t sting you.</li>
    <li>Visited Wolf’s Lair – a must go but definitely book a tour and go early to avoid the crowds.</li>
    <li>Auschwitz – a very humbling experience. An upsetting place to visit but everyone should. Take sunscreen and wear comfortable clothing as there's lots of walking. Don't take photos.</li>
  </ul>
