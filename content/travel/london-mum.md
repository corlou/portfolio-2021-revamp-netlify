  I said good bye to my in-laws and welcomed my mum. She was on her own trip to visit London and do a bus tour all the way up to Scotland.
</p>

<p>
  As I was still working as a teacher, I didn’t go. However, we did go and see “Wicked” on stage, went on the London Eye and had chips. All the things our respective husbands did not want to do.
</p>

<p>
  Go and see “Wicked”. Again, I won’t spoil it but it has a lot of answers to “The Wizard of Oz”. I completely forgot that I was watching a theatre production as the story really drew me in.
</p>

<p>
  We also made a stop at Sissinghurst Castle Garden which were in full bloom. It was beautiful.
</p>

<p>
  Also, I did at some stage went and saw “The Curious Incident of the dog in the Night Time” with my husband (my students were studying it). That was an absolutely brilliant production. Lights, hidden storage on stage, trains, acrobatics… incredible. Go and see a theatre show in London.
