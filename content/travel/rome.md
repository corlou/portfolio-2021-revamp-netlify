    It was very hot and crowded in Rome so we broke up the site seeing over a couple of days.
  </p>

  <br>

  <h4>First trip: Colosseum</h4>

  <p>
    Using the same knowledge we gained from Florence, we walked up to the monument and we were immediately surrounded by last minute tour guides offering skip the line tickets. Sure, its more expensive but you only have to wait for a max of 15 minutes.
  </p>

  <h5>Tips</h5>

  <ul>
    <li>Drink plenty of water</li>
    <li>Stay in the shade as much as possible</li>
    <li>Wear comfortable shoes</li>
    <li>e prepared for personal space to be invaded</li>
    <li>Buy a one way train ticket</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    I suggest one way because your ticket is valid only for the time you have purchased it. So, you cannot board a train at 2pm when your ticket says 4pm otherwise you risk a hefty fine. As we didn’t know what time we were heading back home, we got one way tickets.
  </p>

  <br>

  <h4>Second Trip: Trevi Fountain and Sistine Chapel</h4>

  <p>
    Our Uber driver took us all the way from Termini Train Station to the front of the Trevi Fountain. It certainly has a “wow” factor when you first see it. Due to the new rules, you cannot sit or stand on/in the fountain (who on earth goes swimming in the fountain?) or you will be fined. So, grab a high up seat and just appreciate the view.
  </p>

  <p>
    There is a dress code for the Vatican and I suggest you read up on it else you’ll get refused at the door (unless you buy . an expensive shawl from peddlers). Dan and I got skip the line tickets again but were told that the tour would take two hours.
  </p>

  <p>
    We were only there to see the Chapel so, as soon as we were able, we left the tour group and went along to find it.
  </p>

  <p>
    Worst. Crowd. Ever. Loads and loads of people all squished every where. Finding the Chapel was complicated without a tour group but we got there and it was beautiful.
  </p>

  <p>
    I would have to say that after longing to go to Italy for most of my life, it did not live up to my expectations. Though, this was completely my fault. I've been wanting to go since high school.
