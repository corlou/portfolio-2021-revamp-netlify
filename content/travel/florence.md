  <p>
    It has been my dream to visit this part of Italy for a very long time. We waited until the warmer months as I wanted an Italian summer and I am glad we did.
  </p>

  <p>
    We stayed outside of Rome in the region of Municipio XI as it was cheaper than staying in the city itself.  There is jasmine growing everywhere and it’s hot (30 degrees +). From here we went to see Florence and Rome.  Though, as it is a fair way from Municipio XI, we stayed in Florence for two days.

  <h5>Tips</h5>

  <ul>
    <li>The more effort you put into learning the language, the friendlier people are.</li>
    <li>Wear comfortable shoes and cool clothing in summer time</li>
    <li>We showed up on a weekday to see “The Statue of David” and the lines were HUGE.</li>
    <li>Dan and I bought tickets from “Visit Italy Today” who were standing around outside the building (45 Euros each) and we didn’t have to wait as long.</li>
    <li>We got right to the front of the statue but photos were not good as they didn’t capture the entire height (17 feet tall!)</li>
    <li>Get normal coloured gelato as it tastes better.</li>
  </ul>
