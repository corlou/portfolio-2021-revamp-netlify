    Dan and I spent the day walking around London and absorbing the fact that we are actually here. It’s crowded but I was feeling inspired with the amount of theatre shows going on. I made plans to go and see a show at The Globe Theatre but at this stage in my life, it was more of an intention to go.

    However, later in the year, I put my foot down and booked a ticket to “Macbeth”. Brilliant show full of costumes and impressive props. My seat was last minute and I could only see part of what was happening but I still crossed it off my list of things to do.
