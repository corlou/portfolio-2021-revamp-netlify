  Oh Venice, *sigh*… Sorry, I have a love affair with Italy. Must be the food, the culture, the beautiful language… It was a stunning place. My father-in-law joined us for this part of the trip. After spending a short time in Poland with Dan’s lovely aunt, we were off to Venice.
</p>

<p>
  It was much cheaper to stay in Murano, a small island just off Venice and get the ferry over. They are famous for their glass works so be sure to check them out. We were also glad that we stayed there as Carnival was happening around this time and the place was packed with people. Three sleep deprived travellers trying to figure out the ferry for the first time did not go down very well but we eventually made it.
</p>

<p>
  Despite what people say, it did not stink. Not one bit. The constant flow of water doesn’t allow for stagnation but that could also be the time of year we went as well.
</p>

<p>
  Now Carnival is something else. People spend thousands on their elaborate costumes and masks, while others spend all year making them. I truly lost my composure when I saw two dressed as Jedi knights with lightsabers. I was too excited that I couldn’t even tell my husband and father-in-law to turn around. Just flapped my hand and gasped like a fish out of water.
</p>

<p>
  Also while you are in Venice, take a gondola ride. Yes, it seems like a very touristy thing to do but you get a history talk while floating along gently. It was a great experience.
