    We stayed in Almere, just outside of Amsterdam. It was cheaper and away enough from the city where we could get some peace and quiet to do our work.

  I really wanted to see Amsterdam because of the Van Gogh Museum and we went very late in the day (almost closing time). The crowds weren’t too bad and I got to see his works up close. “A Starry Night” is in New York but the rest were there. His “Sunflowers” painting was gorgeous.

    We both started to feel unwell so we went back to our AirBnb without exploring too much else in the city. Which is fine, I really only wanted to see the museum and by this point in our travels, we were both getting over the crowds of people.

    Almere is a lovely little town with great walking trails. The train was easy enough to work out and ran quite frequently into Amsterdam.
