    <h4>Find out whether you need a visa</h4>
      <p>If you are not an EU citizen, then there are rules for how long you can stay in the Schengen Zone without a visa. I’m from Australia and working on getting Polish citizenship through my husband so I was able to stay longer than usual. I initially had to get a workmign visa as I was going over there to teach highschool English in Sevenoaks, but then after I quit to go travelling, I had to look up the rules of how long I could stay and where.</p>

    <h4>Prescription Medicine</h4>
      <p>Remember, these are my experiences. I’m on the contraceptive pill and took the packaging with me to the next country. It’s good that I did as the new doctor was able to match up/get as close to the ingredients in my current pill. Even when the box was written in Flemish and I was in Poland. Speak to your current doctor before travelling and get their advice. This was just my personal experience with a medication that my life wasn’t truly dependant on. Also, some medicines may be difficult to obtain, so be careful of that.</p>

    <h4>Phone</h4>
      <p>Make sure your phone is unlocked by your service provider before leaving your country. You will be charged massive international fees OR your phone will lock you out when using a foreign sim card. This happened to me when I was travelling in New Zealand and I Wasn't able to use my phone at all.</p>

  <div class="col xs="4" sm="3" md="3" lg="3" xl="12">
    <h4>Bank</h4>
      <p>Tell your bank that you will be overseas and when you are roughly expected to be back. Nothing like getting an email warning that international charges have been made to your card. Though, I am grateful to the bank for their diligence.</p>

  <div class="col xs="4" sm="3" md="3" lg="3" xl="12">
    <h4>Charging Devices</h4>
      <p>Get a universal adapter so you are not carrying around hundreds of different cables/plugs. You can get adapters which have multi-plugs you can use pretty much anywhere.</p>

  <div class="col xs="4" sm="3" md="3" lg="3" xl="12">
    <h4>Invest</h4>
      <p>Invest in a good backpack and trainers. You will be running for the train and running for the bus. Our shoes (North Face Hedgehog) have Gore-Tex inside them so they were perfect for the snowy grounds in the Shetland Islands and Warsaw. My backpack will hold around 15kgs of luggage. The various straps make the weight feel evenly distributed and it can be classed as carry-on by most airlines (but do check before booking).</p>
