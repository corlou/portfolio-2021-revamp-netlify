    Blaenau is a small town of about 2000 people in Wales. It used to be a prosperous slate mining town before the mines were closed.

    The Airbnb we stayed at was unique. Very clean with a bar at the top and a small cinema attached. We came here specifically for the underground trampolines and zip lining called “Bounce Below“. Its an incredible experience and loads of fun. Bookings are essential.

    The rest of the town is lovely and the locals are interesting people. At a particularly hard to find pub, we walked in and for a brief moment, I thought we walked into someone’s house. Then we noticed it was quiet as all the locals had stopped to stare at us (maybe it was my blue hair?).  Very unnerving. Dan flashed a smile and said “Helô” and we were welcomed like family. They even fed us after the football/rugby game on tv.

    Everyone speaks English really well here but do pick up some phrases in Welsh. It’s only polite.

    Remember to also visit “Model Bakery” for some pastries. The man who runs the shop is a rich and lively character and the Kurdish pastries are absolutely delicious.
