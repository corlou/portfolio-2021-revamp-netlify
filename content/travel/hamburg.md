    I wanted to go to Germany…just because. The people you meet when staying in AirBnb’s can be very interesting and it’s fun to step into some one else’s life for a little while.

    One place, we were vegetarians for the week. Another had a fun guy with his beautiful dog, and another was very water saving conscious. All of these made up a rich experience that I would not trade for a fancy hotel.

    The area we stayed in had a lot of aggressive looking people whose… pack would be the best word to describe their group; took up the entire footpath when walking. However, we went out into the main city with our hosts for these very tasty burgers (yes, hamburgers in Hamburg), an old war submarine tour and a general wander around the city.
