    <h5>Overview</h5>
    <p>
        This courses explores and plays with tomorrow's present, the ideas and theories of others as well as adding our own, through experimentation, prototyping, possible products, strategies. A basic understanding of innovation will be developed and then placed in the contexts of design, culture, futures and economy; the history of the concept; and contemporary demands for innovation methods and products, including the notion of creative leaps and the process of incremental progression.
