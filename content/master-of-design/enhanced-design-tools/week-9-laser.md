    This week I modified the Thingiverse file to suit my needs. After the first one of the night, I removed some of the finer details to speed up the laser cutting process. By the fourth iteration, it was a success!

    Now that I cam confident with the file being cut with cardboard, the next step is to do it with 4mm plywood. Note: buy at least two sheets from uni just in case!
