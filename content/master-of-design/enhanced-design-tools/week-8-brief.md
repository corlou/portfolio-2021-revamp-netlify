   Brief: I’m going to do a TARDIS pencil sharpener that lights up and makes sounds when sharpening the pencil. I want to do this because it doesn’t exist, I enjoy Doctor Who, and this project will help me explore a range of skills I gained in class.

  <h5>Skills needed:</h5>
  <ul>
    <li>Laser Cutting</li>
    <li>3D Printing</li>
    <li>micro:bit</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    The first thing I did was find a <a href=https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:19824>Laser Cut TARDIS file</a> on Thingiverse and test the cutting with cardboard. Below is my first attempt:

    As it can be seen, the file is too small for what I need. I want to add a battery operated sharpener, electronics and may also need to include the breadboard. Furthermore, I wish for the doors to open and close and this file does not allow for that. I need to modify the file and do another cardboard cut.
