    A microprocessor is an integrated circuit that contains all the functions of a central processing unit of a computer.
  </p>

  <p>
    Today we received a kit full of fun electronic parts (see image below) and the main one we experimented with tonight was the BBC Micro Bit. We went to the website <a href=https://makecode.microbit.org/#>Microbit</a> and added some simple commands for the lights to show up.  It was fun!

    Anytime the code was added to the micro bit, it would erase the old one. So great care must be taken to save the file to the computer as well so it’s not lost. Remember to name it well using shortest words possible.  “Code 1” is not specific enough.
  </p>

  <p>
    Also, when testing sections, use dots and not words because words are too long.

    Below are some of the examples of my micro bit with codes.

  <h5>
    Homework: How do Microprocessors affect my Industry?
  </h5>
  <p>
    It’s a great way to learn how to code. Most design jobs I have applied for require me to know HTML and CSS. So, once I understand the concepts of coding using a microprocessor, I can use those skills across any programming language. Furthermore, I can switch between Blocks or Java Script for the microprocessor which will help me learn JS.
