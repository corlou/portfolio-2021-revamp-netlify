        Today we experimented with laser cutting. My classmate and I got mixed up and thought we had to prepare the stencils <i>before</i> class. So yesterday, she and I went to the library and used Illustrator to trace some stencils. After carefully reading the instructions and watching some tutorials, I drew up a cat in 0.01 Red (from the RGB colour scale). Feeling brave and wanting to experiment, I added some eyes to be cut out.

        For the purposes of being able to see the designs, I have made them 1 instead of 0.01. The eyes are going to be cut out of both stencils but my name “Corina” is going to be an etching – hence the letters being black. Red is for cutting, black is for etching. How thick the black line is and how dark the black is will determine the width and depth. Furthermore, there was a slight difference with the chosen font and the one which was etched due to the PC not having the same one as my Mac.

    <h5>Homework:</h5>
    <p>
    Throughout this studio we have familiarised ourselves with the Laser Cutter. However, how is this technology facilitated within your industry/your discipline. For class each week we will revisit what you have research about this technology. How does this technology affect your discipline? What are the possible future for this technology?

    <h5>How does laser cutting affect my industry?</h5>
    <p>
        I do a lot of online work but there will come a time where I need to do some sort of printing. For example: Someone needs an “out of the box” solution to promote their business or themselves to stand out from the competitors.  Take Andy Morris. He made a Lego piece that looks like him and used that as his CV with a card that says <a href=https://www.andymorris.eu/legocv>“Unwrap your newest employee”</a>
    </p>
    <p>
        Something that’s a bit simpler would be a laser cut business card using wood, acrylic, metal, or leather would be different and more exciting than a CV that’s just paper.
    </p>
    <p>
        Laser cutting changes my industry because I’m no longer printing on just paper. I would need to take my designs into account for above mentioned materials. What parts need to be cut out? What parts need to be embossed/engraved? How does the file need to be set up to take these things into account?  These are issues I don’t have to consider when designing for 2D prints.
    </p>
    <p>
        Below are some examples of business cards on metal, wood, and acrylic. Please note: they are not my designs.

    <h5>What are the possible futures of this technology?</h5>
    <p>
        Speed up the manufacturing process, cutting with more precision, less waste, and the lasers won’t get dull; unlike other cutting machinery.
    </p>
    <p>
        It also allows more creative freedom when it comes to designing and printing. For example: “The unique qualities of laser cut surfaces add elegance to food and cosmetic packaging that would be difficult to achieve in any other way.” Taken from <a href=https://graphicartsmag.com/articles/2010/02/laser-cutting-applications>Laser Cutting Applications</a>
