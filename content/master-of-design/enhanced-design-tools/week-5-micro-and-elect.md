    WOW! This class was difficult but fun. We used our microbits from last week and connected them to the breadboard, added some wires, created some code and made the led light come on with a press of a button.
  </p>

  <p>
    Then we added some more wires, some more code, and then the led light could be dimmed by turning a device. After that, we added a fan that would turn on for a few seconds, then off again, then back on again in a cycle.  All by itself!
  </p>

  <p>
    Finally, we added some code which could enable the fan to be slowed down by the turning device. It was great!
  </p>

  <p>
    I really do need to play around with the wiring parts as that got confusing. I need to remember that the track goes up and down, NOT left to right.

  <h5>
    History of the breadboard
  </h5>

  <p>
    In the early days of electronic engeneering radio and electronic freaks used real bread boards (litereally cutting boards for bread) to prototype their circuits. Taken from <a href=https://www.instructables.com/id/Use-a-real-Bread-Board-for-prototyping-your-circui>Use a Real Bread-Board for Prototyping Your Circuit</a>
  </p>

  <p>
    No soldering is needed and using a breadboard to test out electronics is a great way to prototype the wiring before putting it all together.

    Homework: How does this affect my industry?
  </h5>
  <p>
    These free computers are designed to get people more excited about creating new software solutions, and learning how things work. This in turn will get more people into the IT industry which makes it imperative for me to stay ahead of the competition. In order to do so, efficient prototyping and testing is crucial, especially when it comes to short deadlines.
