    This week we experimented with the microbit and making lights turn on and off. The programming was hard but the end result was delightful. The images below are snapshots of the wiring.

    So now that the wiring is complete, it's time to turn on the lights. Below are some examples of the lights with different colours. The specific colours chosen are programmed with a micro:bit.

    As a designer, it makes me curious as to why there are not more performances with design and technology. There is Vivid in Sydney, Field of Light in Uluru, and Burning Man. However, there can be more ways to use this type of tech to really push the boundaries and see what crazy and inspiring things can happen.
