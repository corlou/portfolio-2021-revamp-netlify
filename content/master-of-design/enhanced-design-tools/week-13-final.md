    So here it all is: the collation of everything from the past few weeks all put together in one project. It has been incredibly fun and only a little frustrating which I found surprising.
  </p>

  <p>
    Here is the final code for the micro:bit completed on <a href=https://microbit.org/code>microbit.org</a>
  </p>
  <p>
    Once I figured out the logic statements “if this”, then everything else fell into place. I didn’t need the breadboard to prototype the code; it went straight onto the microbit which was wired onto the neopixel. However, I'm glad I planned for the breadboard to be inside because I needed the extra room.

  <h5>Pulling apart the sharpener</h5>
  <p>
    This was the fun and anxious part. I needed to strip back the sharpener so it would fit but also remember what pieces go where. A few weeks ago, I brought one into class and did not take any photos of pulling it apart. MI had no idea of how to put it back together. So this week, I made sure I had a new one (from Officeworks for $10) and got some photos at the stages of disassembly. Then the copper parts had to be moved around to establish a connection without the casing (for safety reasons, the sharpener was designed to only operate when all the parts are together).

    Now it is time to paint the TARDIS and put it all together. I made sure that putting the TARDIS together was the last thing I did because anything could have happened and certain parts would have been made difficult to put in (e.g the sharpener) if the box itself was already glued.
