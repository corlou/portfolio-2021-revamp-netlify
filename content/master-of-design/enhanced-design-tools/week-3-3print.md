    <h5>3D Printing: Tux the Linux Penguin</h5>
    <p>
        I like penguins so a 3D printed one would be a fun one for me to try out on the machine.  I downloaded a file from <a href=https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1809605> Thingiverse</a> and printed it up. Below are images of the process and the final product.

        Using Cura, I was able to fiddle with the size and filling of the 3D print. Now it's time to print it and have a cute desk buddy.

        So, there was a retraction issue and too much flexing which resulting in a sad looking Tux.  Therefore, I will need to change the settings and have another go next week.

        Week 4: Another trial of 3D printing Tux.
    </h5>
    <p>
        So, I fixed the retraction issue by clicking “turn off retraction” in Cura and tried again. This still didn't work. Finally, I scrapped the idea of having a little Tux penguin for my desk and went with something really simple: a ring with cat ears. I was running out of time, so I picked the file that looked closest to my size and upon the advice of one of my classmates; instead of selecting my own settings, I selected “Recommended”.

    <h5>
        How does 3D printing affect my industry?
    </h5>
    <p>
        3D printing is a way for companies to streamline their processes and manufacturing <a href=https://99designs.com.au/blog/design-other/5-ways-3d-printing-is-affecting-the-design-industry>“Through 3D printing technology, it is able to create models in two days that once took four to six weeks”</a> so as a designer, I may have to start learning how to design products that can be 3D printed.  Or at least I have to design faster because production time has been cut down.
    </p>
    <p>
        As 3D printing becomes more and more user-friendly, the demand for quality designs will increase. Any one can design but not everyone can design well.
    </p>
    <p>
        Another concept is that companies would want their logos printed in 3D. Below are some examples of 3D logos (please note, they are not my designs). So, I would have to figure out how their logo looks like from 2D to 3D.
