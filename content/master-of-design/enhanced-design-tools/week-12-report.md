  <h5>Research Snippets</h5>
  <p>
    A breadboard is a circuit board to prototype and test electronics. “So why do we call this electronic “circuit builder” a breadboard? Many years ago, when electronics were big and bulky, people would grab their mom’s breadboard, a few nails or thumbtacks, and start connecting wires onto the board to give themselves a platform on which to build their circuits.” <a href=https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/how-to-use-a-breadboard></a>(Short, M., Joel E.B)
