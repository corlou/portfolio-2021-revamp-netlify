    This was really fun. I partnered up with Kirsty and together we went through the steps of programming in the MIT website and then scanning the QR code to our phones to make it work.

    This type of coding then testing to see if it works is a great skill to have in my industry. Write a bit of code then test everything is a great way to see if things break or if it all works, move onto the next addition of code then testing it. The constant iteration helps me to find mistakes early and fix them rather than going back to try and find a needle in a haystack later on.
