  <h5>HTML Forms</h5>
  <p>Forms are used to pass information from a webpage to a server. They allow entry of data into databases using PHP or another server side language. Which in turn allows us to do an enormous amount of data processing.</p>
  
  <h5>JavaScript Validation</h5>
  <p>If you are entering data into a database, you want that information to fit a certain data type. Common validators are: Name, Email, Numbers</p>

  <code>
  input type="number" name="age" min="0" max="150"
  </code>
