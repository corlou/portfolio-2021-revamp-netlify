  <h5>XML</h5>
  <p>
    XML (eXtensible Markup Language) is specifically designed to display and share data. It does this by keeping data in plain text format so that it can be easily shared by different platforms.
 </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Goes in a separate file(file.xml)</li>
    <li>XML tags are case sensitive</li>
    <li>All XML tags must be closed(good practice anyway!)</li>
    <li>All elements must be properly “nested”</li>
    <li>All attributes must be in quotation marks</li>
    <li>A root element must always exist</li>
    <li>Can create your own tags</li>
  </ul>

  <h5>JSON</h5>
  <p>JavaScript Object Notation</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Written in curly brackets</li>
    <li>Doesn’t use an end tag</li>
    <li>Faster and easier to write</li>
    <li>Faster to be processed due to strings</li>
    <li>Only needing to be parsed rather than the whole XML document be read in and put into variables.</li>
  </ul>

  <h5>Database queries</h5>
  <p>
    SQL (Structured Query Language):
    We are only going to focus on SQL in the course of this subject as it is the most widely used and versatile.
 </p>
  <ul>
    <li>SELECT</li>
    <li>UPDATE</li>
    <li>DELETE</li>
    <li>INSERT</li>
    <li>INTO</li>
    <li>WHERE</li>
    <li>AND</li>
    <li>OR</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    JSON, XML, and Database queries are the “backend” side of websites. These websites are known as “Database driven”
