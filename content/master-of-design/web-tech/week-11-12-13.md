  <h5>Final Assignment</h5>
  <p>
    Create a website using all the tools we have talked about over the semester. You must include HTML, CSS, and JS. The website can be a personal portfolio or something else. To submit, please zip your project and submit it through Turnitin along with a reference list.

  <h5>My Website</h5>
  <p>
    Dan, myself, and our housemate regularly host couch surfers. They come from all over the world and stay with us for a few days (sometimes up to two weeks max). We get a lot of the same questions such as "what to do here?", "where to eat?", and "how to get around". So, I came up with an idea to create a website that will handle of their questions and help navigate around Brisbane. Once they have booked via the couch surfing website, we send them a link to my website which will enhance their stay with us.

  <h5>Link to the Live website</h5>
  <p>We didn't have to make the website live but as I thoroughly enjoyed making it and there was a real use, I bought the domain name and published the site using Netlify.</p>
