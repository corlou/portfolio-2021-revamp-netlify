    Progressive Enhancement is necessary so that older devices and browsers are still able to access modern websites gain the bare necessities from them, such as core content, and basic functionality.
  </p>

  <p>Some guiding principles:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Basic content of the site must be accessible to all browsers</li>
    <li>Functional on all browsers</li>
    <li>Enhanced layout using external css</li>
    <li>Enhanced functionality using external javascript</li>
  </ul>

  <h5>What are the benefits?</h5>
  <p>
    Improved accessibility - Vision impaired people cannot read a screen at all. Using PE we continue to make our websites accessible for text and screen readers.
  </p>

  <p>
    Increased compatibility -Websites remain effective through utilization of the principals of PE and Responsive web design, including media queries, CSS3, and HTML5.
  </p>

  <p>
    Performance boost - The layered approach ensures that content is loaded first, then the styles, and then the behaviors.
