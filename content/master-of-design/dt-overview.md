    <h5>Overview</h5>
    <p>
        This course will help students develop a common language and understanding of design thinking which can be used across multiple scenarios and sectors. As a human-centred approach to problem solving, design thinking introduces non-designers to the concepts of the design thinking process and also offers designers an advancement on their tried-and-tested approaches to creative problem solving.
