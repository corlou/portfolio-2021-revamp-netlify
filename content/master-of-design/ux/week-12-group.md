    The presentation is coming together nicely. After a few minor alterations here and there; it's really starting to come together. Below is a list of things I need to bring for the group presentation next week:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Purple hair spray</li>
    <li>Cardboard that looks like a phone</li>
    <li>Document print outs</li>
    <li>An item that looks like a sander</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    We have decided to act out our user engagning with the app. This lessens the pressure on the whole assignment as we are going to have fun with it. Carolyn will be the narrator, Pund will be the Share Bear, and I will be the user named "Emma" from our persona. We have a fair idea of what we are goign to do but the rest will be improvised.
