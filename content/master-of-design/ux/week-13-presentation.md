    The presentation went really well. Some parts were amusing because we didn't find a coffee table to use as a prop so I grabbed a chair in class and used an empty hamburger box as my sander. I was a bit concerned with our lecturer thinking we were making fun of the assignment but a few times I saw her laughing, so it's all good.
