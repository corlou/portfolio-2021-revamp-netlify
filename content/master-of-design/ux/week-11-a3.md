  <h5>Concept for the assignment:</h5>
  
  <p>
    Share Anywhere will make it very easy for people to participate in and benefit from the sharing economy by helping them discover services relevant to them. Currently there is no easy way to find sharing services without searching the Internet or asking friends for recommendations. Most users don’t know that such a wide range of services exists, and they have only heard of a few dominant services.
  </p>

  <p>
    Share Anywhere will allow users to explore what’s available, but will also proactively suggest sharing services based on personalised factors such as current GPS location, the user’s stated interests, previous search patterns, known lifestyle factors and friends’ online recommendations. This will open peoples’ eyes to possibilities they may not have previously considered. Meanwhile the quality control of service listings will engender more trust and reduce barriers to take-up and use of sharing services. This reflects the findings from research, which indicated the service should address users’ need for trust, convenience and quality.

    Carolyn has divided up the work and each of us has a vital role in getting Assignment 3 completed. My job was to draw up the logo and the wireframes for the app.
