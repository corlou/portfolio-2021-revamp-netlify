    <i>Could you introduce yourself, in terms of academic background and work experience? (around 100 words)</i>
  </h5>

  <p>
    My degree is “Bachelor of Teaching/Bachelor of Arts: Secondary” which I obtained at the University of Newcastle. I taught high school for five years in Australia and England but then decided to move into IT. I am now a contractor for Danitt Pty Ltd and have built WordPress sites, designed a logo, smartphone apps and a content management system. I manage social media accounts for a business and run an e-commerce store where I designed the t-shirts and socks. Lastly, I am learning how to code in HTML and CSS.

    <i>Have you done any work or projects on experience design before? If yes, what are they? (around 100 words)</i>
  </h5>

  <p>
    There are three significant project where experience design had to be taken into account. The first one is Two Sheds Workshop. They wanted a website where students can make class bookings and it had to be a simple one so that the owner Jo, could manage it herself. The second one was the BidBarn app. Luke (the owner) wanted an app where his customers could make bids, rather than filling out the sheet. It had to be easy to use because his primary market is people in their late forties. The third one is the Fleet Management System for Stay Upright where employees can let mechanics know when there are issues with a bike and at what training centre.

    <i>What is EXPERIENCE DESIGN? List FIVE aspects to describe how you understand it. (around 200 words).</i>
  </h5>

  <p>
    Experience Design to me is making technology easy and simple to use. If it is difficult to use, impossible to navigate and find what you want, or simply doesn’t do what it is supposed to do; then that results in a poor experience of the product/technology.
  </p>

  <ol>
    <li>It’s about finding the user’s point of pain and modifying the designs to fix it. A difficult to navigate website makes people leave quickly.</li>
    <li>It’s more than just making things look pretty; it’s about making things simple and functional.</li>
    <li>It’s the point of contact between humans and technology.</li>
    <li>It’s not just about customers experiencing the product, it’s about the employees too. If they have trouble with the product/technology, then efficiency of the business will diminish and the customers will not return.</li>
    <li>Great user experience will logically and simply lead the user from step to step to complete the task. Whether it is entering information, buying an online product, or making a reservation; the process is quick and minimalistic.</li>
  </ol>

    <i>What are the THREE things you would like to learn in this course? Why do you think they are important? (around 200 words).</i>
  </h5>

  <ol>
    <li>Fully understand and complete the sequential steps in the UX design process. It’s important because I know how to design for easy use but I’m not familiar with the step-by-step process.</li>
    <li>How to streamline the UX design process so I can complete jobs faster. This is important because clients want a product at a certain time so I cannot be spending all my time on UX; the thing needs to be built as well.</li>
    <li>How to complete UX more effectively. I have completed work that includes UX but I need to know if I am missing anything. This is important because there are things I don’t know that I don’t know which once uncovered, I could be a better UX designer. With a formal education, I can fully understand what I am doing, how I am doing it and why I need to do it in a particular way.</li>
  </ol>
