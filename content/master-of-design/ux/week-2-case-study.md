    This week we looked at e-commerce in China and the challenges that go along with it.  Below are the worksheets for this topic.
  </p>

  <p>
    The PowerPoint presentation was to choose a service and how can we come up with better UX. My group chose Jora (for job searching) as we believe there are improvements to be made.

    B2C is Business to Consumer. This means a business is selling to a customer. Amazon is an example of B2C.
  </p>

  <p>
    C2C is Consumer to Consumer. This means that a customer is selling to another customer. Shopify is an example. Most people who run a Shopify website, are buying products cheaply, adding their own mark-up and then re-selling to customers.

  <p>
    Online to Offline. “provide online information, services, or discounts to consumers that enhance their offline shopping experiences.” Taken from <a href=https://www.techinasia.com/o2o-industrys-stupidest-acronym>TechinAsia.</a> For example: Groupon provides discount vouchers for offline things such as movie tickets and meal vouchers (buy one, get one free).
  </p>

    If you were to design an e-commerce site in China, what XD solutions would you suggest for enhancing consumer trust in online purchases?
  </i>

  <ol>
    <li>Alipay as a neutral third-party payment gateway</li>
    <li>Customer feedback on items and the seller’s response</li>
  </ol>

  <i>How does Alipay work?</i>

  <p>
    Alipay is a neutral third-party payment gateway and you need a Chinese bank account to be set up for it. A consumer puts their money through Alipay and when they have received the goods, the funds are then passed onto the seller. This enables the seller and consumer to be on equal footing during the transaction and both are protected from fraud, not paying for the goods/service, disputes (at least some) and refunds. It builds trust between both parties.
