  <h5>Important Definitions to remember: </h5>

  <p><span class="data-definitions">Demographic:</span> Facts e.g. Name, Age, Sex etc.</p>

  <p><span class="data-definitions">Psychographic:</span> Thoughts and opinions and they can change over time. E.g. Favourite colour, food, animal etc.</p>

  <p><span class="data-definitions">Intergroup:</span> between/among groups. E.g. Compare Group A against Group B.</p>

  <p>
    <span class="data-definitions">Intragroup:</span>
     Within the same group. E.g. Compare Group A now with Group A previously (i.e Now vs. 6 months ago but with the same group).
  </p>

  <p>
    <span class="data-definitions">Qualitative Research:</span>
     Exploratory research to gain an understanding of underlying reasons, opinions, and motivations.
  </p>

  <p>
    <span class="data-definitions">Quantitative Research:</span>
     Numerical data or data that can be transformed into usable statistics.
  </p>

  <p>
    <span class="data-definitions">T-Test:</span>
     compares two averages (means) and tells you if they are different from each other. The t test also tells you how significant the differences are; In other words, it lets you know if those differences could have happened by chance.
  </p>

  <p>
    <span class="data-definitions">Pearson Correlation Analysis:</span>
     A measure of the linear correlation between two variables X and Y.
  </p>

  <p>
    <span class="data-definitions">Least Squares Regression Analysis:</span>
     Statistical technique for estimating changes in a dependent variable (such as expenditure on food) which is in linear relationship with one or more independent variables (such as household income, size of the household, dietary needs, etc.).
  </p>

  <p>
    <span class="data-definitions">P-Value: </span>
    the probability that the data would be at least as extreme as those observed, if the null hypothesis were true.
  </p>

  <p>
    <span class="data-definitions">Null Hypothesis: </span>
    the hypothesis that there is no significant difference between specified populations, any observed difference being due to sampling or experimental error.
  </p>

  <p>
    <span class="data-definitions">Homogeneous: </span>
    Of the same kind
  </p>

  <p>
    <span class="data-definitions">Heterogeneous: </span>
    Diverse in character or content
  </p>

  <h5>Sampling</h5>

  <p>
    The idea behind selecting a sample is to be able to generalise your findings to the whole population. Therefore, my sampling must be a <i>representation</i> of the population.
