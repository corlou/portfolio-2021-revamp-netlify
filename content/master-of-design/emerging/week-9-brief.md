    It turns out that the <a href=https://www.dw.com/en/indian-engineers-design-electric-anti-rape-bra/a-17798277>electric bra exists already</a>. The dye packet option is good but it will ruin the clothing of the person being groped, the same with the skunk spray.

    I have been advised to get a grounding story and get my concept from there. I need to ask the questions of Would it? Should it? Could it? and don’t get trapped by the clothing idea.

    I then thought of a piece of jewellery  that has a spy camera in it so the attacker can be caught on film… this too already exists.

    I need to cast a wider net and then narrow down. Maybe I can do something with anxiety? I really want to stay away from app development because now is the time to try different things, experiment, fail, and try something new. I want to get my hands dirty and build a physical thing. I think will stay with wearable tech and somehow incorporate the tools that are available to me - laser cutting, 3D printing, and microbit programming (thanks Enhanced Design tools!)
