    A manifesto is a declaration of policies, aims that a person/persons wish to reach. We looked at Manifestos, what the are, who writes them, and what it means for me as a designer.

  <h5>My Manifesto</h5>

  <ol>
    <li>To experiment, to fail, to try a different way.</li>
    <li>Keep trashing about and make waves.</li>
    <li>Keep building things and trying new technology</li>
    <li>Play and be creative</li>
    <li>If we only get this one life, then you should try it all.</li>
  </ol>
