  <i>“Every act of creation is first an act of destruction.” – Pablo Picasso.</i>

  <p>
    I have found that digital revolutions and disruptions are not only common in IT, but they are the lifeblood of our industry. Our craft has the capacity to overturn virtually any facet of any field, often forcing out old habits and established patterns, in pursuit of capitalistic efficiencies.
  </p>

  <p>
    Throughout my career in IT, I’ve borne witness to a number of notable disruptions, including:
  </p>


  <ul>
    <li>Open Source Software (OSS)</li>
    <li>Project Management & Versioning</li>
    <li>Digital Outsourcing / Remote Work</li>
    <li>Cloud Software & Code Repositories</li>
    <li>Digital Communication</li>
  </ul>
  <br>

  <h5>The Open Source Movement</h5>

  <p>
    An excellent example of this trend, is the gradual domination and defeat of Microsoft Encarta against the Open Source rival of Wikipedia. Encarta was an encyclopaedia sold on a CD-ROM in the 90s then later moved to a subscription website in the early 2000s. Millions of dollars was invested into the software, research, marketing, and design. Then along came Wikipedia.An open-source (free) encyclopaedia that anyone could contribute to. Eventually, Encarta could not compete and soon closed down. This one particular example really paved the way for open source in the industry I currently work in.

  <h5>Project Management & Versioning</h5>

  <p>
    The processes behind developing and distributing global software have undergone rapid improvements over recent years. The notion of versioning in particular (eg GIT, SVN, Mercurial) has enabled programmers to collaboratively edit, share, and revise software in teams of 100 or more, all whilst keeping a clear history of individual responsibility and code changes throughout the lifetime of the project.

  <h5>Cloud Computing</h5>

  <a href=https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud_computing>What is Cloud Computing?</a>
  <p>
    Example: Dropbox, Spotify, Netflix – all relying on internet to provide services, especially ones that we once used to download or buy directly to our homes (owning the storage on USB or hard drive and now renting the storage in the cloud).

<h5>Digital Communication</h5>

<ul>
  <li>Effective communication is the cornerstone to IT productivity</li>
  <li>Email paved the way to efficiently collaborate remotely</li>
  <li>Following email, a flurry of chat software has come and gone, bringing with it instant chat, audio and video capabilities with ever-improving quality.</li>
</ul>

<h5>Digital Outsourcing / Remote Work</h5>

<ul>
  <li>Remote working has revolutionised the hiring/employment practices of IT industries</li>
  <li>Dispelled the time-honoured traditions of performing work in the office</li>
  <li>Allowed to access to human resources anywhere in the world, not limited to local talent</li>
  <li>Is sometimes cheaper and more efficient to outsource for smaller jobs</li>
</ul>
