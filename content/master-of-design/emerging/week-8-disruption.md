    Lectures have finished and it is now time for me to design for disruption. We looked at the Royal Society of Arts competition and their design briefs to get an idea of what we can do for the next assignment. Below are my two ideas.
  </p>

  <br>

  <h5>Idea One: Too many kids are addicted to video games.</h5>

  <p>
    When the parents try to take away the video consoles, the child then becomes violent. Recently, the WHO classified addiction to gaming as a <a href=https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/nation-now/2018/06/18/gaming-disorder-who-classifies-video-game-addiction-health-disorder/709574002>health disorder</a>
  </p>
  <p>
    What if I created a device that got kids to do squats before they participate in gaming? Or if there are raised voices in the room, it automatically switches off the tv. Moving on from that, there are some kids who borrow their parents’ credit cards and rack up <a href=https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/press-releases/2014/01/apple-inc-will-provide-full-consumer-refunds-least-325-million>large bills for in-app purchases.</a>
  </p>

  <p>
    How can we prevent this? Can there be an extra layer of security such as the tv takes a screenshot of the room and the tv screen itself and sends it to the parents’ phone to make them aware of the credit card purchase.
  </p>

  <br>

  <h5>Idea Two: Hal for Home</h5>
  <p>
    Instead of putting some one in a nursing home, artificial intelligence could be used to help the person/s stay at home longer. Hal, the AI would make appointments and be ready to call emergency services, should the person/s need it. Hal could also keep them company by engaging in conversation. Some nursing homes have proven to make <a href=https://www.businessinsider.com.au/problems-with-nursing-homes-2014-10>the resident worse off with abuse and neglect</a> therefore, being able to stay at home longer with the help of AI, would be beneficial.
  </p>

  <br>

  <h5>Idea Three: Wearable Tech</h5>

  <p>
    Women (and men) who are <a href=https://www.bbc.com/news/newsbeat-45381687>groped</a>, their item of clothing gives either: an electric shock, squirts a dye that is difficult to wash off, or release a skunk-like spray. With the #MeToo movement and the constant talking about unwanted advances, people are still getting harassed. Check out the reaction towards Ariana Grande getting groped by a bishop at a funeral. People are well aware that it is not ok to touch some one if they don’t want you to.
  </p>

  <p>
    While I agree that this type of clothing should not be needed; we still do. “Behavioural Learning occurs when a response to a stimulus is reinforced. Basically, operant conditioning is a simple feedback system: If a reward or reinforcement follows the response to a stimulus, then the response becomes more probable in the future.” From: <a href=https://www.funderstanding.com/theory/behaviorism>Funderstanding</a>
  </p>

  <p>
    So, if some one was to grope another person (and being fully aware that they shouldn’t), an immediate consequence should deter their future behaviours. A child learns that the stove is hot and doesn’t touch it again. A perpetrator who gropes and gets an immediate and painful reaction should, in theory, have the same result.
