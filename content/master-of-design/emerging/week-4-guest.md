    Today our guest lecturer was Andrew, a professor in Digital Arts who made some interesting points on creativity and AI.

    “You invent the tool and the tool invents you” – Andrew.  This quote reminded me of M. C Escher’s “Drawing Hands“

  <h5>Here are the rest of the notes I took: </h5>

  <p>
    We use technology to enhance and assist our lives.
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Glasses to help us see</li>
    <li>Cranes to help us lift</li>
    <li>Bikes to go faster than we can run</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    A.I could also help us do similar things and to go beyond what we are currently physically capable of.
  </p>

  <p>
    A.I processors can be generative (make things)
  </p>

  <p>
    Creativity of and with technology.
  </p>

  <p>
    Margaret Boden:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Combinational = merge two or more things</li>
    <li>Exploratory = try new things/new ways</li>
    <li>Transformational = make things better/improve</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Computers are good at solving stuff that is clear and measurable.
  </p>

  <p>
    Creative projects – no clear/ideal solution.
  </p>

  <p>
    Difficult to describe a criteria.
  </p>

  <p>
    A.I Assisted does not mean A.I only.
  </p>

  <p>
    It’s easy to make things but judgement of what makes it good is hard.
