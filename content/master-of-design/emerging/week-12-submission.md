    Feeling anxious in certain situations can help us avoid danger, triggering our ‘fight or flight’ response. It is how we’ve evolved to keep ourselves safe. Sometimes though, we can become overly worried about perceived threats – bad things that may or may not happen. Some anxieties come in the form of:

  <h5>Emerging Futures: Embedded Microchips</h5>

  <p>
    The microchip is about the size of a grain of rice and usually inserted in the webbing between the thumb and forefinger using a needle the same thickness as used in body piercing.
  </p>

  <p>
    Some 3000 Swedish people are trying out this chip to swipe into their work, login to computers, and even operate the printer.
  </p>

  <p>
    Even a molecular biologist, entrepreneur and futurist named Meow-Ludo Disco Gamma Meow-Meow took an Opal card (NSW equivalent of the Translink Card) cut down the Opal chip, had it encased in biocompatible plastic and then implanted it just under the skin on his left hand by a piercing expert in April 2017.
  </p>

  <p>
    Below is an example of an embedded microchip in the webbing between the thumb and forefinger. It holds a small amount of information such as being able to unlock doors, swipe into work, and operate a printer in that office.

  <h5>So how does microchipping and anxiety work together?</h5>

  <p>
    From my research and personal experiences, people with anxiety can get overwhelmed with the amount of surrounding stimulus. Sometimes triggering an attack of feeling nauseous, scared, angry, and the general desire of having to get out of the “threatening” situation.
