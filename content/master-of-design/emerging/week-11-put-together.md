    A person with anxiety can use a ring to turn down the volume of their surrounding environment. This will give them a feeling of control while at the same time reducing external stimulus. The subtle and natural gesture of playing with jewellery will also help encourage the user to engage with the technology as it does not draw attention.

  <h5>Embedded Microchips in Humans – Research</h5>

  <p>Important acronyms:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>NFC near-field communication</li>
    <li>RFID – radio frequency identification</li>
  </ul>

  <b>Under the skin: how insertable microchips could unlock the future article.</b>

  <p>
    The microchip is about the size of a grain of rice and usually inserted in the webbing between the thumb and forefinger using a needle the same thickness as used in body piercing.
  </p>

  <p>
    Once the needle is removed the incision heals in a few days and the microchip remains, allowing the wearer to open doors with the brush of a hand – provided they only wish to access one particular place.
  </p>

  <p>
    Commercially available insertable microchips are only large enough to hold one access code and a small amount of other information, so the days of replacing an entire wallet and keychain with a tiny computer under the skin are not yet upon us.
  </p>

  <p>
    The future is coming, but it’s not in a rush.
  </p>

  <p>
    Heffernan is doing a PhD on the applications of insertable technology and decided to get a chip after a year spent listening to people wax lyrical about the convenience of never having to carry their keys.
  </p>

  <p>
    Heffernan’s original chip usually contains a link to her website, which people can access if they scan her hand with their phone, provided they have the near-field communication (NFC) capabilities switched on. At the moment, it just says “hello” because she is demonstrating that it could be reprogrammed.
  </p>

  <p>
    The security risk, she says, is quite low.
  </p>

  <p>
    “The read range is very short, so you have to be touching my hand,” she says. “I’m going to know if that’s happened. And even for a nefarious purpose, if someone knocked me out, let’s say, it has my website on it. It doesn’t have anything useful that they’re going to be able to take.”
  </p>

  <p>
    But what about tracking? She says it is possible the chip could be used to track bathroom breaks but that would only be if employees required people to swipe to get into the bathroom, a function that could also be tracked via a standard swipe card.
  </p>

  <p>
    “The chip has no tracking capabilities,” Heffernan says. “They don’t have any battery and they don’t have any GPS sensors … If someone was going to track you, they’d use your cell phone.”

  <b>Human Microchipping Is Here, and It’s About to Rock Your Skin’s World.</b>

  <p>
    Some 3,000 Swedish people have inserted a microchip into their bodies to make their daily lives easier.
  </p>

  <p>
    People with the implants can, for instance, wave their hand near a machine to unlock their office or gym, rather than taking out a key card.
  </p>

  <p>
    So-called “biohacking” is on the rise as more people depend on wearable technology and interconnected devices.
  </p>

  <p>
    Many microchip users are not concerned with hacking or surveillance at this point.
  </p>

  <p>
    The tiny, grain-of-rice-size RFID (radio frequency identification) chip opens doors with a wave of your hand in front of a chip reader. And at Pause Fest, an Australian tech expo, 10 VIPs volunteered to swap paper tickets for implanted-­microchip ones. Imagine an internal key fob.
  </p>

  <p>
    The RFID chip isn’t the only technology being used. Grindhouse Wetware, a biohacking start-up in Pittsburgh, is experimenting with powered implants: The RFID chip is powered by the device it interacts with, like the card scanner on your office door, while the implants are powered internally by a battery.
  </p>

  <p>
    Cofounder Tim Cannon inserted a monitor slightly smaller than a stack of credit cards into his forearm that would read his temperature and, through Bluetooth, transmit that information to his Android. The monitor, called Circadia, can be used to control a Bluetooth thermostat or to call an ambulance if Cannon’s temperature spikes or drops too suddenly. “This was to prove that we could design and implant a subdermal device in the body for nonmedical purposes,” says Ryan O’Shea, a spokesperson for Grindhouse Wetware. “We’re looking at what abilities humans could have evolved to have biologically but didn’t,” he says, pausing. “Like bioluminescence.”

  <b>Are embedded microchips dangerous? Ask the Swedes – and pets.</b>

  <p>
    The FDA said it was looking studying to address “concerns” about the potential effects of RFID chips on “medical devices” like pacemakers and defibrillators.
  </p>

  <p>
    It has been claimed “Safe than a piercing, and as dangerous as getting blood taken at the hospital” – Biohax CEO Jowan Österlund.

  <b>Meow-Ludo Disco Gamma Meow-Meow Really Wants You to Care About Science.</b>

  <p>
    But Meow-Meow’s credentials and political perspective extend beyond his interesting name. He is a molecular biologist, entrepreneur and futurist who believes in the pairing of scientific research and technology, according to his candidate page on the Science Party’s website.
  </p>

  <p>
    “My background is in genetics, and I think that the biggest things that I’m bringing are an evidence based approach to policy,” he told HuffPost Australia.
  </p>

  <p>
    “The reason I’m in politics is because I looked at a lot of parties that are making policies based on ideology but not looking at facts. Being a scientist, that’s really distressing.”

  <b>Biohacker’s Opal hand implant cancelled, court fight looms.</b>
  <p>
    The body-hacking scientist who implanted an Opal card chip in his hand claims the NSW government has finally made good on threats to cancel his pass.
  </p>

  <p>
    But the defiant “biohacker” is preparing to fight the move in court.
  </p>

  <p>
    He cut down the Opal chip, had it encased in biocompatible plastic and then implanted it just under the skin on his left hand by a piercing expert in April 2017.
  </p>

  <p>
    That came to an end at some point over the weekend when Mr Meow-Meow returned from Body Hacking Con in Texas to find his implant’s card was not working. “I was actually at a cyborg convention, which is kind of ironic and hilarious,” he said.
