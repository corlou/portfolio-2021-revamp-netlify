    This is a practical course where we will look at things that are impacting on the world. E.g. Bitcoin, Uber, AirBnb/Couch Surfing, Tap & Go, PayPal, Block Chain, Tesla etc. We will also look at disruption and how it equals innovation.  There are calculated risks that are based on a need. People can also create innovation by adapting current products and developing new technology for it e.g. Self-driving cars.

    <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sophia_(robot)>Sophia</a> is a huge disruptor, especially since she is the first AI with citizenship. This also caused an uproar as her <a href=https://www.beyondsciencetv.com/2017/10/27/people-are-outraged-that-sophia-the-robot-has-more-rights-than-most-women-in-saudi-arabia>citizenship is in Saudi Arabia
    </a> and has more rights than the average human female.

    Steve Jobs and Apple are another example of disruptors, along with Facebook, Instagram, and Pinterest (and their warped perceptions of life).
