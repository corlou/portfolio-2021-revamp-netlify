    Critical Design: critical design uses speculative design proposals to challenge narrow assumptions, preconceptions, and givens about the role products play in everyday life (from lecture notes).
  </p>

  <p>
    Speculative Design: speculative design is a discursive practice, based on critical thinking and dialogue, which questions the practice of design.

    This week, my class mates were presenting disruptions to their industry.  Here are my notes on things I found interesting/haven’t thought of before:
  </p>

  <h5>Disruptions in Interior Design.</h5>

  <ul>
    <li>Virtual Reality – see the finished design and be able to walk around the room instead of trying to picture it.</li>
    <li>Augmented Reality – Add layers onto an existing reality e.g. use an AR app to add furniture to an existing space</li>
    <li>Advanced materials such as self-repair concrete, carbon fibre and electrified wood (Wood-E)</li>
    <li>Smart gadgets for the home.</li>
    <li>Can use SketchUp with VR as it helps find inaccuracies</li>
  </ul>
