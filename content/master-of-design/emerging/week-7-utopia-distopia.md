    This week I partnered with Ana and we discussed what a Utopia and a Dystopia would look like based on our assignment topic.

        <h5>My Utopia – The Sharing Economy</h5>
          <ul>
            <li>Every one shares resources (free or reasonable value)</li>
            <li>Learn to treat things with respect</li>
            <li>Close the class gap</li>
            <li>Help the homeless/teenage run aways</li>
            <li>Greater sense of community</li>
            <li>Less debt – people borrow expensive things rather than buy what they cannot afford.</li>
            <li>Sustainable – people buy less “stuff”</li>
          </ul>

      <div class="card-body">
        <h5>My Dystopia – The Sharing Economy</h5>
          <ul>
            <li>Forced to share things</li>
            <li>Reduced sense of achievement from hard work</li>
            <li>Risk of some one breaking the items/s</li>
            <li>Some people cannot be trusted and will find a way to work the system</li>
            <li>Who will get priority of the item?</li>
            <li>People get complacent – why work hard for nice things when I can just borrow?</li>
            <li>Invasion of privacy</li>
          </ul>

  <p>A person’s utopia can certainly be another’s dystopia.</p>
