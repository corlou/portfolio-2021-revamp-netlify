    After a few hiccups with my ideas, I came up with a few:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>An app to help introverts know when public places and transport are quiet/empty.</li>
    <li>A ring to find other introverts wearing their ring so they can hang out together</li>
    <li>A ring to manipulate one’s environment.</li>
  </ul>

    </div>
  </div>
<!--/IMAGE-->
  <p>
    This is a ring that lights up when other introverts are around when they want to meet in a public place. The lights will shine blue if the user is facing the wrong direction and go green when they are in the right direction.
  </p>

  <p>
    I have found this to be complex and wish to simplify as there is a lot going on. It needs to be feasible based on research, contain an emerging future, and be disruptive. I need to explore what I can do and how far I can push it.
  </p>

  <p>
    So, the ring will now be a device that will control the introvert’s environment.
