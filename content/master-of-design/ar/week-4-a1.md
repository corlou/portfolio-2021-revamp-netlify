    <h5>Pokémon Go App</h5>
    <p>
        Augmented Reality (AR) is adding another layer onto our current reality. AR uses what is already there and builds upon it by adding characters, colours, stories, experiences, and even sounds for a unique experience. One particular app thoroughly covers all of these elements when it blasted onto the tech scene in 2016: Pokémon Go. It is a free smartphone app that employs AR so that players can get a true to life experience with capturing, training, and evolving Pokémon (see the image below).

    This particular AR installation was chosen because it is more than a just a game; Pokémon Go has had a significant social impact around the world and in more ways than just the context of coaxing players outside.

        Pokémon Go inspired one animal shelter to advertise players to come and walk their dogs while out playing the game. “There are people walking dogs [right now], posting pics on their Instagrams and social media. That exposure for the dogs is really quite epic.” - Phil Peckinpaugh. Pets were adopted, users went outside, friends were made, and even some abandoned animals were rescued. Therefore, it can be seen that AR can create significant social impacts on communities.

        The technological underpinning of the app is after the users download the free app from either the Play or App stores onto their smartphones, they must enable certain access to the following technologies: “GPS, mapping and satellite services and combines them with location services, landmarks and Nintendo’s familiar characters.” (Hsu, D. n.d) to play the game. Users also have the option to make in-app purchases when they run out of Pokéballs and when they need other equipment to keep going with the experience.

        Furthermore, “the game creation is on Google’s Platform as a Service (PaaS) providing a mobile backend.” (Gupta, K. 2017) while also employing Google Maps to create a specific environment. The code itself to create the app uses Java, C++, C#, with Libdgx as the framework while the database itself is NoSQL (which is perfect for the app as the data itself is messy, unstructured, and unpredictable).
    </p>
    <p>
        The context of the experience is to get people out of the house and exploring their local areas. It cannot be played at home and users need to physically go out and search for new Pokémon, conquer gyms, and battle other trainers. The intended audience is both old and new players alike. “One of the major reasons behind Pokémon GO’s breakout success has been its ability to leverage the power of the Pokémon brand and reach the players who grew up with the franchise.” Therefore, Pokémon Go can attribute a significant part of its success to those who grew up with the television show and card games.

        There are a few historical precedents to Pokémon Go but not so much with games. Star Walk is an AR astronomy app that identifies constellations by holding up your phone to the night sky. This app also “provide extensive facts about the various bodies users spot” (Jamie, 2019). A user holding their device up to interact with AR is the same as Pokémon Go.
    </p>
    <p>
        Personally, I like the use of Augmented Reality over Virtual Reality (VR). It adds to what is already there and VR seems so impersonal. We are more connected than ever yet rates of loneliness are on the rise. “We are more focused on talking to someone thousands of miles away rather than someone who is right next to you.” (Benny, 2017). However, with AR, one can still connect with the people in close physical proximity and share the experiences.

        In conclusion, Pokémon Go is in interactive AR application built with a variety of programming languages that had a significant impact on society upon its first release. AR is another way for people to connect with each other through the use of technology and interact with the outside world. The app has created a few copy-cat apps such as Harry Potter but it would be interesting to see where the technology will go next.
