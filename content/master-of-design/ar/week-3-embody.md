        Embodied interaction - interaction systems treat the physical world as a medium rather than a metaphor.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
        People are already familiar with how to interact with real toys so they jumped in and started telling their own stories. There is no need for tutorials.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
        Take physics into account - if something drops in reality, make sure it is reflected in AR/VR. Also, take into account peoples' personal spaces and who they are (visitor context).
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
        Orientation of the visitor is something that I also need to take into account. Give people activities to do and nothing is more thrilling than giving some one something to create. Or move things to discover clues for the next activity.

        <li>Embodied Interaction (social and physical interaction in the world)</li>
        <li>Embodied Metaphor (kinesthetic metaphors developed in childhood)</li>
        <li>Proxemics (movements/personal spaces)</li>
        <li>Situated actions (plans are dependant on situations as they develop)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        The body is limited in certain experiences. If we look at the way the body can interact, it makes for a more powerful experience.
