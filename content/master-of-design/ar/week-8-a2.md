    Right, I have played around with Zappar and seem to have my head around it. I did a small practice at first and then will complete the rest of the assignment. I wanted to do a small example to see what I can do before moving onto a more complex piece.

        Here is <a href="https://www.loom.com/share/d013010aed5e4dd6b2552e8d395fdf17">an instructional video</a> I completed on Loom of the process I did. Below is the image. Download the Zappar app and you can use it to scan the image which will bring up a AR button. This links to a YouTube clip about the Globe Theatre.

        Below are screenshots of how the button appears as an AR on the app. My finger is near my laptop screen to demonstrate that it is an AR piece being viewed through another device and not a basic screenshot.
