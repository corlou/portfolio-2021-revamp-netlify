        So, there is a drawback with ZapWorks. Being that my free trial expires in 8 days and I still need access so my teacher can grade it. Therefore, I will have to create a new account, do all the ZapCodes again and then submit the work. Oh, I will need to test them too. In the meantime, here are the screenshots of what I have been working on (please note that these images include old zapcodes and therefore cannot be scanned).

        Pretty cool how the image, button, link, and videos can appear like that. I find that they can rest a bit on my hand but not covering the code all the way. Fun. Soon, I will need to repeat the project on a new account with another 30 day free trial. I don't wnat to pay the $250 per year if I will only use it for this assignment. HOWEVER, I would be willing to do so if the future requires it.
