        Nothing will compel a visitor
        to do something more than
        the inner desires of the visitor,
        and if we can speak more to
        those desires, the better we’ll

        not just the whats, but the
        hows and the whys. - Brillhart, Jessica (2016) In the Blink of a Mind — Attention, Medium.com, 16th Feb
