        First trial with the supplied code from <a href="https://github.com/jeromeetienne/AR.js/blob/master/README.md#Get-Started">Jerome's Github repo</a> enabled me to view a yellow cube on my phone. See the screenshots below:

        Next I tried to change the yellow square to pink to see what would happen. In my experience, I have found that obtaining some one else's code then making small changes at a time has really helped me to understand how things work. It's also easier to change them back if things do break and start from the beginning/the last time it worked.

        So, the pink cube has worked which is a very exciting time. Now, to see if I can change the cube to a different shape and colour. I have changed the "a-box" part of the code to be "a-sphere" to see if that changes the shape and the material='color: pink;' to material='color: blue;' to see what happens. Below are the results:

        Now to see if I can change the Hiro image to something else.
    </p>

    <div class="row">
        <div class="col">
            <img src="/img/master_of_design/masters_ar/pattern-cat2.png" alt="cat">

    <p>
        Changing the Hiro image to one of the cat didn't yield any results and I'm not sure why. I have tried to use the <a href="https://jeromeetienne.github.io/AR.js/three.js/examples/marker-training/examples/generator.html">Marker Training</a> website to see if it can be generated there but it will only allow me to download the marker image as a .patt file but not as a PDF. So, I then tried to I tried to shortcut this by simply drawing the image in Illustrator and keeping it within the box but to no avail. So, I need to ask my lecturer and get his thoughts.

        Questions I need to ask:
            <ul>
                <li>How do I make my own Hiro maker and make sure it works in the code?</li>
                <li>How do I change the shape from either a cube or sphere to something else that can be obtained from <a href="https://sketchfab.com/">SketchFab</a></li>
            </ul>
