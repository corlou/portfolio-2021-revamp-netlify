    <h5>Motivations</h5>
    <ul> 
        <li>Unique to the area</li>
        <li>Not a linear story</li>
        <li>What is the story of South Bank</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        Why and what is the premise? Look at motivations and extend them into new things. Look at where have they been and where have they gone, how can I interpret their story?
    </p>
    <p>
        How did I enhance the average day of the user visiting South Bank? What mechanisms did I use to add to their experiences? Surrounding the motivations of people. Why do they want to visit South Bank? Don’t tell them, show them. How to explore, don’t tell them.

        So, I was going to do business cards with images of the places my guests go to and have them grouped by location. Then, as I as riding my scooter home, I was thinking "why would guests carry these around?". So I thought of things that they woould carry. Maps. They would carry maps. I am going to do one for the assignment.
