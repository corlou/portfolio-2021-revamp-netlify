        I missed class this week due to a mix up at work but below are some notes I found about AR.

        Augmented reality (AR) is an interactive experience of a real-world environment where the objects that reside in the real-world are enhanced by computer-generated perceptual information, sometimes across multiple sensory modalities, including visual, auditory, haptic, somatosensory and olfactory.[1][2] The overlaid sensory information can be constructive (i.e. additive to the natural environment), or destructive (i.e. masking of the natural environment).[3] This experience is seamlessly interwoven with the physical world such that it is perceived as an immersive aspect of the real environment.[3] In this way, augmented reality alters one's ongoing perception of a real-world environment, whereas virtual reality completely replaces the user's real-world environment with a simulated one.[4][5] Augmented reality is related to two largely synonymous terms: mixed reality and computer-mediated reality. - <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Augmented_reality">Wikipedia</a>

        AR is essentially adding another layer to our current reality while VR (virtual reality) is creating a new world entirely.
