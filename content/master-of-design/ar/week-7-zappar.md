        So I managed to get the sample code working again (the blue sphere) but that doesn't solve my problem for assignment 2. No one in the class has anything working and it has become quite stressful.

        Thankfully, one of my classmates stood up for about 20minutes and gave ashort presentation on what she has done with Zappar. It has been, well, a god-send really. Being an artist, she has no technical knowledge and has managed to get the assignment two to work. So, I shall play around with it and see what happens!
