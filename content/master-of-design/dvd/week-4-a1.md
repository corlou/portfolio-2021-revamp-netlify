        Brief:This week was about creating a stencil, using the laser cutter, and then spray painting it. I read the supplied article "Beyond ‘Revenge Porn’: The Continuum of Image- Based Sexual Abuse" by Clare McGlynn, Erika Rackley, and Ruth Houghton. I wanted to create a piece that reflects their message "revenge porn is a form of sexual abuse. Most of the time, it starts off with an innocent exchange between two people but when one becomes the aggrieved party due to a break down in the relationship, they seek revenge on their partner."

        After reading a few articles and discussing the topic of design being used as a form of protest, I picked the topic of revenge porn. Sex is a fascinating topic for me and it is interesting where people draw the line. Should we be able to send what we want to who we want? Where lies the blame for that content being distributed? If the supplier of the image didn't send it in the first place, there would be nothing to pass on. OR does the blame fall on the receiver who then passed the content onto others after the creator of the content broke their heart? Is it the creator's fault for creating, sending, and then upsetting the receiver?

        The first quote I had was "Even though I sent it, doesn't mean you can post it." This was not as powerful/hard hitting as "I broke his heart... He destroyed my life." It is shorter and more memorable.
