    <h5>Brief:</h5>
    <p>
        You have been provided with images/content for a project proposal. David Harris and Paul Bardini have designed a mixed media interactive artwork designed for public installation. They require the concept to be presented on one A2 Landscape display panel.

        I don't like any of them. I'm struggling to find the balance between clarity of text and images while using InDesign. More research is needed for inspiration.

        The one on the left was taken from Google images which inspired my final one on the right. I like the neat box shapes as it gives the content a clear structure. I probably could have decreased the space in the middle parts and extended the outside border a bit more though. All in all, I feel that it's an improvement so that is good.
