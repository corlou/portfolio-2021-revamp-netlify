        The Queensland College of Art has a diverse range of studio spaces designed to support Design students during their degree. Our laboratories, studios and discipline-specific spaces have been custom designed to engage Griffith students in an optimal learning experience. These spaces span a broad spectrum of study areas and industries. Our workspaces are perfect for unleashing creativity and delving deeper into a range of arts practices.

        The one on the left (in purple) was the first iteration. I'm not very confident with InDesign but I think it turned out alright. Here are the following dot points from the feedback:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Add a transparent box</li>
        <li>Use more red - Griffith colours</li>
        <li>There's a lot of white space</li>
        <li>Remove purple background and change to red?</li>
        <li>Watch text gaps</li>
        <li>Increase caption sizes</li>
        <li>Play with the order of the elements</li>
        <li>Diagonal grid/other shapes</li>
        <li>Play around with the floor plans (colour, make part of the background etc).</li>
        <li>What is the main element? (text? image? slogan?)</li>
        <li>Include the Griffith logo</li>
        <li>Grid means consistency, not just the white spaces.</li>
    </ul>
