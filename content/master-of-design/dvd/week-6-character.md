        I got confused as to what the homework was and completed some character designs. However, there was no homework due at all. This was frustrating... but I got a lot of hours in with Illustrator so I guess there's that.

        Gallery Interiors requires a poster showcasing some of their sample interior outcomes. The poster will be added to their co working space, and additional posters will be added, in the same style, when they have more images of future projects.

        I like the first one the most because it's the cleanest and makes the most sense. Though, I wanted to branch out and experiment with different colours and styles that I don't normally use. I really like using blues and greens so taking a shot with warmer colours put me out of my comfort zone.

        The third poster is an orange version of the blue one as I wanted to use elements that I'm familiar with before really branching out. I feel that it was progress in the right direction, though, more practice with InDesign overall is needed.
