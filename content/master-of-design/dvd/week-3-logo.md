        This week's challenge was to create a logo for a clent. I thought a little bit about what the logo would look like when it was tiny but to be honest, I wanted to design a lavalamp in a labcoat.
    </p>
    <p>
        Brief:
        The client is an event lighting company that specialises in interactive lighting. They would like a logo design that incorporates an icon and text ‘Lava Lamp Lab’. Their target audience is hipster start-up companies that have events to promote launches and promotional parties for urban based corporations.

        After the critique, I removed some of the elements. I heard a quote once, the job is not finished when nothing can be added; it is finished when nothing can be taken away. I need to explore the idea of "less is more". How far can I go with removing things before the image/logo looses the meaning/identity?
