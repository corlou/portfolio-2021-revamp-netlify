        This class requires weekly work which my classmates will critique. This kind of design feedback is something I have been lookiing for so I'm lookinf forward to this trimester. I am apprehensive for the use of InDesign for assignments as I am not familiar with it. However, my skills in Illustrator and Photoshop will hopefully pull me across the line. Below is my design for the first week and in Week 2 post, I will make the modifications after receiving feedback.
