    <h5>Overview</h5>
    <p>
        This course aims to introduce and foster good practices for learning techniques and skills, as well as the capacity to work with a variety of digital visual media. Students will be introduced to basics of graphic media through Adobe Creative Suite as well as interactive and 3D media including Google Sketchup. A framework for critical evaluation of digital visual media culture will also be introduced, exploring the impact and potential of social media, co-design, open source design and peer2peer technologies. A considerable portion of learning will take place in the studentâ€™s own time, using online tutorials to master basic skills which will then be reinforced and assessed through in-class assessment.
