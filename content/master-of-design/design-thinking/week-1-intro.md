        Design thinking has no special sequence of events. It is messy, fun, and non-linear. To try and make it linear is next to impossible. There are always changes to be made, new ideas arise, and unforeseen problems occur.

        Can anyone be a designer? Yes.
        Can anyone be a good designer? Yes, BUT with training, education, and experience. Without it; it would almost be like giving some one a camera and calling them a professional photographer. There are all sorts of tip, tricks, and nuances that separate some one from being good and some one being great.

        I tend to agree with some of the things she says but I also think that some design choices are not so obvious.  Or the ones that are perceived to be obvious… well that is probably because they have been done that way for so long that it's ingrained in us and our way of thinking. Kids and cartoons, girls with pink, boys with blue etc.

        Does her idea of CRIT involve the user in any way? Or is it just the design team’s CRIT? I have found that both are fundemental in obtaining to most effective critiquing.
