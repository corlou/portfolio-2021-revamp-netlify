        There are many different ways to get your thoughts and ideas out. Brainstorming is the most common way but here a few new favourites I want to try:
    </p>
    <ul>
    <li>
        <b>Brain Writing</b> 
        Like brainstorming, but everyone writes down and passes ideas for others to add to before discussing these.
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>Worst Possible Idea</b> 
        An inverted brainstorming approach, emboldening more reserved individuals to produce bad ideas and yielding valuable threads.
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>Movement</b> 
        A “what if?” approach to overcoming obstacles in ideation and finding themes/trends/attributes towards reliable solutions.
    </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        Today’s lesson was about coming up with ideas of how to solve a class member’s Problem Statement we did in Week 3. The ideas got pretty crazy, especially with these separate requirements:
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>Every idea must cost at least $1 million to create</li>
        <li>Every idea must get you in trouble with your boss.</li>
        <li>Every idea must involve fantasy or magic.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>
        My problem statements have been either too vague or not related to the topic of phones. So here is my latest one: Caitlin is a time poor mum who cannot keep up with her full time studies despite using her phone calendar. She needs a better way to keep track of due dates.
