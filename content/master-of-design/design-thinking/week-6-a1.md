    <p>
        This week we brought in what we have done thus far with Assignment 1 and got feedback. It is due next week and getting a second/third opinion is great.
    </p>
    <h5>Some feedback for mine:</h5>
    <ul>
        <li>Change the colour scheme- too bland</li>
        <li>How will I set out the poster? Whatâ€™s the layout?</li>
        <li>Problem statement has way too much detail</li>
        <li>Going too much into UX, need to pull back and look at the project as a whole.</li>
    </ul>
