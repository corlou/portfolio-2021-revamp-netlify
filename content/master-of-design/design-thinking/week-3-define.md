    <p>This week was all about defining the problem. From our lecture notes this week defining the problem is:<i>"Definition of a meaningful and actionable problem statement, which the design thinker will focus on solving.”</i></p>
  <p>
    While this part is the most difficult; it is the most useful. Finding out what the problem is and breaking it down to it’s simplest form will enable the designer to pin-point exactly what needs to be solved.
  </p>
  <p>
    In my industry, there are lots of people with great app ideas but it’s not really a problem that needs to be solved. Why should we build this app? What value does it create? Is it solving your individual problem or many other peoples’ problems?
  </p>
  <p>
    As designers we need to keep asking “why?” until we get to the absolute basic issue.
  </p>
  <p>
    Next we did persona profiles on class members. At this stage, I am still finding it difficult to define what the problem is. I know I am doing something with phones but there is nothing specific. I know I need to stop spending so much time on mine but not every one has that problem.

    I was informed that I needed more information in the persona profiles and the re-phrase my problem statements.
  </p>
  <p>
    However, I did have an idea: Both are university students. Both use their phones a lot. Both are overwhelmed with keeping up with everything that needs to be done for the degree.
  </p>
  <p>
    There is a small checklist of things to be done for Orientation Week but there is nothing after that.  University students could benefit from a longer check list and the dates that those things can be done on.  During Orientation Week, I attended a meet and greet with my lecturers and found out some other things I needed to do for my degree. Others could not make it. So, they missed out on learning about the student association.  This could be included in the check list. Kinda like a Student Calendar app.

  <h5>User Profile Questions</h5>
  <p>
    I found that my initial questions did not help me define a specific problem but they helped guide me to find more informative questions that will ensure higher quality data. Not everyone is attached to their phones and I need to cater for that and not be so biased. Having bias when researching will not render accurate results, I need to be more impartial.
