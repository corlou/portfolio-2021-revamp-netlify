    <p>Now I know the top three things people desire to have on the app (Timetable, Map, and Grades), it is time to start designing the app itself. I do want to note that I have been looking forward to this part!</p>
    <h5>What do I need?</h5>
    <ul>
        <li>Images</li>
        <li>Colour</li>
        <li>Phone outline</li>
        <li>Storyboard (?)</li>
        <li>General layout</li>
        <li>User profile</li>
        <li>User Journey</li>
        <li>A way to prototype</li>
    </ul>

        I found this online a long time ago and use it to draw up wireframes. It has been useful in the past and I shall use it again now.
    </p>
    <p>
        I’m using a program called “Sketch” to do the wireframes. It’s perfect for what I need and can help with the prototyping.

        I have sourced some free images off <a href=https://pixabay.com/en/>Pixabay</a> to help with the generic stock images. I have also used <a href=https://ionicons.com/>Ionicon</a>to source the icons needed for the app.

        Here is the first page. It displays the most wanted features (according to the results of my survey) while being clean and minimal.
