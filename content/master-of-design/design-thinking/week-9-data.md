    <p>This week was all about gathering data to ensure that my problem is properly defined. Below are the questions I asked in interviews and on Survey Monkey.`</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Are you a student or staff member?</li>
        <li>Name of your University?</li>
        <li>Do you use the university app?</li>
        <li>If you donâ€™t use the app, why?</li>
        <li>What would it take to encourage you to use the app?</li>
        <li>If you were to use the app, what useful things should be included?</li>
        <li>If you do, what do you use it for?</li>
        <li>List three main frustrations you have with the app.</li>
        <li>What three main things do you want the app to include?</li>
    </ol>
    <p>
        The next step is to collate the data and analyse it. The main focus should be the most popular desired features and functions in order to figure out how to streamline the use of the app. Consideration of current pain points need to also be taken into account.
