    <p>Drawing sketches while brainstorming is a great way to help with flow. Pick an idea from our sticky notes last week:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>An idea that is impactful but quick to create or implement</li>
        <li>The idea unlikely to work, but is the most breakthrough if it did</li>
        <li>The idea most likely to delight the people for who we are designing</li>
    </ol>
    <i>My work:</i>
    <ol>
        <li>Quick: Calendar app with better UX</li>
        <li>Breakthrough: Integrated calendar with Work, University, and Family</li>
        <li>Delightful: Voice notifications for reminders – like GPS voice customisation. E.g. “I pity the fool who hands in the assignment late. You got two weeks!” in Mr T’s voice.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>I was told to eliminate one as it would be hard to prototype – so I am no longer doing C.</p>
    <h5>Prototype:</h5>
    <ul>
        <li>Mock-up</li>
        <li>Storyboard</li>
        <li>Keep it simple</li>
        <li>Fail fast and fail often</li>
        <li>Iterate quickly</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Prototype – be scribbly, don’t be precious</p>
    <p>Empathy – keep close at hand when testing the prototypes</p>
    <p>
        Produce a tangible, low fidelity product rather than talking about it. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yafaGNFu8Eg">This YouTube clip explains it</a>
    </p>
    <p>Check out “Reverse Garbage” in West End for materials</p>
    <p>Pop Up app is good for prototyping – maybe now called Marvel?</p>
    <p>Meetups and Focus Groups are a form of prototyping as you get something out of it and make amendments to your design.</p>
    <br>
    <h5>Poster for Assignment</h5>
    <ul>
        <li>Use Pinterest for inspiration</li>
        <li>Don’t use loads of text on the poster</li>
        <li>Have a hierarchy</li>
        <li>People need to see your journey from week 1-6 but don’t label them as week 1-6</li>
        <li>Outcomes of interviews – use their quotes</li>
        <li>Use a grid to help with layout.</li>
        <li>Have three vertical columns.</li>
        <li>Use simple fonts such as Helvetica, Ariel etc.</li>
        <li>Can use a template if you are struggling</li>
        <li>Best done in Illustrator as it will be printed in A1-A0</li>
        <li>The rest of the lesson was spent prototyping how we would go about designing our product.  We did this through sketching, mind maps, making wallets out of paper etc.</li>
    </ul>

        I observed and interviewed people from all walks of life and how often they use their phones. I tried to think of a way to get people to use their devices less often but we are living in the digital age, there almost seems no point. Plus there are apps already out there to help people manage their time usage on the phone.
    </p>
    <p>
        One thing that kept coming up in the interviews (and for myself too), is that some people use their calendar app, but not many because of the UX issues. The pictures above are about making an Integrated Calendar that incorporated Family, University, Work, and Personal reminders. That is very broad, so it’s time to narrow down.
    </p>
    <p>
        I looked towards the Orientation check list on the University website. It covered a lot of things but not enough. Then my classmates were complaining about not being able to remember all of the things we had to do. I started to piece all of this together.
    </p>
    <p>
        <i>What if there was an app that helped students remember what is due and when? And what if it included the Orientation checklist but it had more items added to it?</i>
    </p>
    <p>
        I did another round of interviews, this time asking adults who are currently undertaking a formal education specifically about the calendars people use. Some use their calendar app, but most have a large one at home with everything on it. This demonstrates that there is an issue with what is currently out there.
    </p>
    <p>Stay tuned for the mock-ups!</p>
