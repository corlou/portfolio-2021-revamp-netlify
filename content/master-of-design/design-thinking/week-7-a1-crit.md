    <p>
        This week we printed out our posters and explained our processes to the class. We then critiqued them and I learned a lot of things from the feedback.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Test the printing early</li>
        <li>Watch font sizes as there are too many</li>
        <li>Watch the spaces and margins</li>
        <li>Bring in a prototype into class – get to this stage earlier</li>
        <li>Define the problem then ask the empathy questions – the interviews became redundant because the definition changed.</li>
        <li>Trim the poster after printing – don’t count on being allowed to do a re-print</li>
        <li>Go and get constant feedback</li>
        <li>Validate storyboard with a user</li>
        <li>Manage my white space – it’s ok to have it.</li>
        <li>Summary of insights are kinda just slapped together at the bottom of the page. Probably put them next to each relevant box next time.</li>
    </ul>
