        For Assignment One, I observed people on their phones in South Bank Brisbane on a late Tuesday afternoon in July 2018. Below are the dot points I made.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Two people sitting with food and one had their phone out.</li>
        <li>At another table, a guy sat down with his food and within two seconds, had his phone out.</li>
        <li>1 in 5 people who walked passed me were listening to music.</li>
        <li>3 young girls in a group waled by and all of them had their phones out in their hands (not looking at the screens, just holding them).</li>
        <li>Every 2 out of three people were carrying their phones in their hands.</li>
        <li>When I was getting the ferry home, there was a long line of people waiting with me and every 2 out of three people were on their phones.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        Me observing people on their phones has made me spend less time on mine and made me realise that if I wasn’t watching them on their phones, I would have been on mine.
