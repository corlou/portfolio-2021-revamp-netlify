        My personal experience with the current university app is one of frustration and annoyance. I thought “surely I’m not the only one who is frustrated.” So, I started asking around with my classmates and others I happened to have a conversation with. They too, were frustrated with the current app.

        In my industry, generally speaking, when a developer finds a good way of doing/completing a task, they tend to duplicate it rather than reinventing the wheel. Templates, code snippets, and wireframes are great examples.

        So, if the Griffith University app was annoying myself and fellow classmates, I wondered if the same functions and layouts were used for other university apps. Which could be causing the same problems and frustrations.

    <h5>Define the Problem:</h5>
    <p>
        University apps are not serving their primary purpose of students being able to gain the required information with ease. Users who do engage with the app are taken to the university website, thus making the app redundant.

        As you can see, despite the amount of downloads, there are many similar complaints about the app. It is also important to note that there is a vast difference between the number of students going through university and the amount of app downloads.

    <h5>How might we?</h5>
    <p>How might we simplify the app to streamline access to the desired information?</p>
