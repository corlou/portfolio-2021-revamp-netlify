        Assignment 2 Progress
    </h5>
    <p>
        I have settled on doing a light and music show at Fortitude Valley Train Station. Below are some research notes on the effects of using classical music in areas that are a bit more rough and tumble than the average public place.
    </p>
    <p>
        "A 2005 report on a program that started piping in classical music to notoriously problematic underground stops in London claimed that robberies had dropped 33 percent, assaults on staff by 25 percent and vandalism by 37 percent at those locations since the music started in 2003."

        Another interesting point is "When people hear music they like, it stimulates dopamine production and puts them in a better mood. But when people dislike the music, their brains respond by suppressing dopamine production â€” souring their mood and making them avoid the music. The Independent reported that the music may repel youth loiterers simply because they view classical music as uncool."

        It seems a bit harsh but it is scientifically fascinating that "a school in Derby, England, got into the news last year by using classical music to punish misbehaving pupils, forcing the disobedient to sit and listen to an hour of classical music. Behavior improved by 50 percent."

        It's interesting that I live in Fortitude Valley and haven't experienced issues myself (thankfully). However, I do feel that staying away from Brunswick St and Fortitude Valley Station at night makes for a safer night. Even if I'm in a group of people, I always ask "shall we take the longer but safer way or is the shorter way going to be alright?" I wonder if playing classical music and having a light show at certain times of the night would decrease the overall dangerous vibe of the place. Below is an article about how other people feel when they are using the train station at night.

        <li>"Passion Weaving"</li>
        <li>A career is not a clear cut path; it is hacking at the bush and going in circles</li>
        <li>What do you want to be when you grow up? Puts people in a role that identifies who they are. People who then retire have a sense of loss because they are no longer defined by their job.</li>
        <li>What do you want to be? Is a better question as a person is no longer defined by their career</li>
        <li>What would my everyday life be like in this role?</li>
        <li>School was about aptitude, not creativity but it is also to hard to judge creativity</li>
        <li>Revisiting the same the same themes in my life but in different ways</li>
