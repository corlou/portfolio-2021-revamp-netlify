        So, the 3D printing didn't work out as the technician said it needed to be an original piece. I don't have time to learn how to draw a 3D model nor get it prepped for printing. Therefore, I won't do the tables and chairs.

        During class, I nipped out to Jaycar to pick up some electronics for the lights. I had a fair idea that I wanted a Neopixel to go with a BBC Micro:Bit as that's what I've done in the past and it worked well. However, after speaking to the lovely Thomas, I walked away with a four strip led lights with an adapter to plug into the wall. It's not what I wanted (I wanted powered by a battery) but the lights are perfect for what I need.

    <h5>Project Summary</h5>
    <p>
        I am going to get a cardboard box, paint it black, add led lights, create a coin-operation slot and a coin, then encourage people to put the coin in a slot in order to activate the lights.
