    Today we did our poster presentation to the class. After looking at the other posters completed by my classmates, I should really work out the grid in InDesign. Ours looks like the separate components are just floating around, there's no structure. I'm all about clean design yet I don't practice it when creating posters. Overall, it was pretty good and I hope these reflections will assist for future assignments and professional practice. Below are some of my other reflections for assignment 1:
    </p>
    <br>
    <ul>
        <li>Slow down my speaking, pause more</li>
        <li>Emphasise important points</li>
        <li>Ask more leading questions for engagement</li>
        <li>Relate more to design practice</li>
        <li>Slow down when speaking</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        The topics that were covered by other groups were:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Protest Design</li>
        <li>Contemporary Design</li>
        <li>California</li>
        <li>Modernism</li>
        <li>Bau Haus</li>
        <li>UX (our topic)</li>
        <li>Pop Art</li>
        <li>Critical/Speculative Design</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <p>
        I enjoyed all of these topics but I found California Design was the most interesting. This is because I believed it was going to be about beachy, sunny, easy-going, surfer lifestyle but this group also touched on Silicon Valley. It was a nice contrast of a laid-back beach lifestyle to the cut-throat start up industry.

        Guest Lecturer - Dr. Mike McAuley
    </h5>
    <p>
        Here are the notes from today:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Good practice is informed practice</li>
        <li>Research is like eating veggies, it must be done</li>
        <li>Title to capture the attention, hierarcy to keep it</li>
        <li>Not just explain the problem, actually makae things better</li>
        <li>Not seek to simply understand, seek to make things better</li>
        <li>Opinions are easy, research is hard work</li>
        <li>Read and create at the same time</li>
        <li>Use a variety of research methods to strengthen arguments</li>
        <li>Always try to see the project in it's entirety, rather than each stage/phase</li>
        <li>Don't just tell the problem, provide a solution</li>
        <li>Bring people into the zone of my project</li>
        <li>Action research = address the problem and help with the issue instead of completely solving it</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <p>
    I like that last point very much. Dr. McAuley's example was when some one was doing a project on climate change, it is impossible to solve the entire thing in one project. Instead, the project encouraged teenagers to switch off the lights when they left the room.

        The above images are from a project completed by one of Dr. McAuley's students. It was a way for the student to express her feelings about her creative anxiety and writer's block - something a lot of people can relate to. I liek the idea of a book, this one in particular folds out completely and has the images on one side and the information on the other. Doing a book for the next assignment is something I'm interested in. Need to find a topic though.
    </p>

    <p>
        Our teacher, Michelle, has suggested to look at The Student RSA Awards and check out their design briefs for inspiration. We were also encouraged that if we cannot find a topic of our own, to use the following:
    </p>
    <br>
    <ul>
        <li>"Beige" = could be used for Interior Design</li>
        <li>Poem "The Unaccompanied" = Typography?</li>
        <li>Sound track "Over there, it's raining" by Nils Frahm</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <p>
        I'm going to spend some time researching as we need to have something prepared for Week 5.
