        What is my element specifically? I want to play with lighting. Not so much sound due to time and tech constraints. Howver, if I were to do sound, maybe I could do something like people put a dollar in a slot on the wall and it plays a song as they walk down the corridor. That dollar then goes to charity. Kinda like reinventing the jukebox while also improving the space. This could be a really fun idea to do and can use it as a back up plan if the 3D printing and laser cutting doesn't work.

        So what kinds of lighting will I use?
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Chandeliers?</li>
        <li>Leds?</li>
        <li>Downlights?</li>
        <li>Track lighting</li>
        <li>Lamps</li>
        <li>Disco and lasers?</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <p>
        Once the type of lights are decided upon, what colours will I use?
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Soft</li>
        <li>Natural?</li>
        <li>Coloured/Multi-coloured?</li>
        <li>Imitation of sunlight and time of day?</li>
        <li>UV?</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <p>
    This is all determined by the mood/atmosphere I want to add to the dark corridors. They are my canvas and it's time to really think outside the box.
