        Fortitude Valley Train Station has a few dark hallways that commuters must walk through to get to and from the platforms. The general concensus is that people do not feel safe walking these dark places and I want to bring a light and music installation into the area to assist with feeling safer as well as overall improve the space.

     My goal is to improve upon what is already there and to encourage the general public to use public transport more than other modes of transport. I also want to improve the overall experience of the train station as that is what commuters see before and after work. After chatting with Michelle (our teacher), I have decided to go with a light installation. There are a few ways in which I can approach it:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Have a light sensor that follows some one walking down the hallway</li>
        <li>Make it look like the sun is shining though a window (even if there are no windows) by playing around with the tones, brightness, and angles</li>
        <li>Have mood lighting such as imitation candle light</li>
        <li>UV lights and glow in the dark paint</li>
        <li>Lights that change colours to reflect the same colours as Story Bridge</li>
        <li>Using a projector to do a lgiht show</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        As for presenting this project, a video may be best but I still want to give the 3D model a go. I'm thinking of 3D pringing and led lights. I did this in another project last year and it was fun. I shall spend some more time thinking about it and plan a trip to those hallways to get a better feel for the space.
