        I'll be honest: I skipped class this week.I did find last week helpful but I really needed to use the laser cutter and 3D printer to sart the building of the assignment. So, I asked one of my classmates to grab any notes while I made an appointment with Alex the technician.

        I grabbed a 3D box model off Thingyverse and will test it out with a lazer cutter. The <a href="https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3670327">link to the box is here</a>. I have also grabbed some 3D printing furniture which I have already prepped in Cura for printing as well. <a href="https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3741550">Here is the link for the furniture.</a>

        I don't know why, but <i>everytime</i> I get a box off Thingyverse, the joints don't match up. Luckily, I decided to use cardboard as my material as it's slighly more malleable than wood. Also, I need to make sure that I have lots of cardboard for testing as the first print is never going to be perfect. Thankfully, there was a bit of spare cardboard in the room.

        So, as it is cardboard, it is easier to manipulate. Therefore, I will make some modifications to the holes and see what happens.
