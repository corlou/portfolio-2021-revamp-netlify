        So, the design was done on PowerPoint and I edited in InDesign. However, I forgot to send all the image files when sharing the InDesign file which made it difficult for my team to edit. After spending a trimester using InDesign, I should have known to do this but oh well, learn from it. Below is the before and after design of our poster.

    I wrote out my part of what I want to say during the presentation. Each of us has a section to talk about and mine are "The Process of UX Design" and "Dood and Bad UX". Below is what I'm planning on saying>
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
    The process of UX Design is to research, empathise, create, review the data, and develop the product/experience.
    </p>
    <p>
        During the research phase, the UX designer needs to gather information about the market and users. Is there a need for this product? Has someone else developed the product/software and what is good/bad? Once all the relevant data is gathered, the next step can be implemented.
    </p>
    <h5>Empathy:</h5>
    <ul>
        <li>What are the user’s pain points?</li>
        <li>What do they need/want?</li>
        <li>Can they navigate the product with ease?</li>
        <li>Testing and scenarios come into play here where the designer/team get together and use market data and target audience to determine the level of technical skill to use/interact with a product.</li>
    </ul>
    <h5>Create:</h5>
    <p>
        Wireframes, mood boards, and mock ups are a low-cost way to test the product for any issues. Is there a clear logical flow from point a to point b? Can the user achieve their goal?
    </p>
    <h5>Data don’t lie: </h5>
    <p>
        Using focus groups to test the product is a great way to get an unbiased opinion/a way to get a fresh set of eyes on the project. Feedback, the good, bad, and the ugly are beneficial to the development of the product. “It’s very important to see out and listen very carefully to negative feedback” (Musk, E. 2014). Once you find out what is bad about the product, it can be fixed now (or later) but one must remember that perfection is the enemy of good.
    </p>
    <h5>Develop:</h5>
    <p>
        Taking on the data, feedback and experiences, it is time to fully develop the product while always keeping the user at the forefront to ensure their experience is a positive one. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3iagXcrjzU">Musk, E. (2014) What Elon Musk says about negative feedback</a> date accessed 23/07/2019.
    </p>
    <h5>Good UX. Vs. Bad UX</h5>
    <p>
        What makes for good UX? Simple, clean, and a logical flow. The user can do exactly what they want to do with ease and minimal steps. Netflix has a multi-directional alphabet to search for your favourite shows and movies. While Stan has a single line of the alphabet which takes longer to get to each individual letter.
    </p>
    <p>
    Bad UX has broken links, hidden information, too much information, clutter, too many fields to fill out, and unhelpful error messages.
    </p>
    <h5>Reflection:</h5>
    <p>
    so, a few groups got to present their powerpoints and posters today and we ran out of time to do ours. However, I studied the print out of our poster and made some reflections about it below:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Next time, make sure there are no borders around the blue boxes or the scroll as it got pixelated</li>
        <li>UX timeline was done in Illustrator but was not saved as a large image and was therefore distorted</li>
        <li>Under the heading "History", there is a hanging sentence</li>
        <li>The poster is not trimmed</li>
        <li>Grid not used</li>
        <li>Needs a blue border at the bottom to match the top</li>
        <li>Make sure all heading fonts are the same</li>
        <li>Remove grey box from the Iphone image</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        However, I feel this poster worked a lot better than the one I did in Design Thinking so this is an improvement. Next week we should be presenting out poster to the class.
