        I believed I was handing in the assignment today. To me it was complete and the lights were working. Below are the images.

        My teacher said that I should try laser cutting the holes to make it neater (especially compared to the punctured ones). I was apprehensive of this as I would have to make them line up <i>perfectly</i>. To my suprise, I did.

        I am slowly starting to put it all together. I did not remember the measure the width of the cardboard for it to slide into hte soda can box and I did try to cut it to size but that did not work. So, I am going to use the one with the pounctured holes but use cardboard and black paper to makea it all look neat.
