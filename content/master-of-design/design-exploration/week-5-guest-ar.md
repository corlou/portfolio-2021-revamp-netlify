        What type of code is required for AR?
    </h5>
    <p>
        Need to export the file in a certain way, use 3D Plugins, Unity, Unreal. Adobe is coming up with their own in late 2019 which doesn't require programming.

    <h5>
        Lil Miquela
    </h5>
    <p>
        A fictional character that has over a million followers on social media and has reached the status of influencer. I asked Dr. Sargent about the ethics of this. We are all influenced by something and there's media and advertising everyewhere promoting a certain lifestyle if you buy these products... How do we monitor/control potential influenece/propagander coming from Lil Miquela and other forms of AR personas? To which Dr Sargent replied that in an interview, the team behind Miquela said that "Lil Miquela is as real as Rihanna. She is a brand, a product, a lifestyle. Miquela is no different." This still makes me uneasy. Humans are fallible, mispeak, and become unpopular. AR forms are calculated, analysed, and scripted; right down to their expressions.

        Assignment 2 Idea: Grand Station Designs from RAS Student Design Awards 2018/19
    </h5>
    <p>
        Design a way to reinvigorate and/or repurpose an ageing commuter train station building, utilising its existing structures and resources.
    </p>
    <p>
        I have chosed Fortitude Valley Train Station as it is a bit of a drab and dreary place. It is what some people see everyday coming to and from work, so adding something small but powerful can create a better user experience. I have a vague idea about adding classical music and a light show on the ceiling in the evenings. It is a high ceiling so it would be difficult to be destroyed. I should do some more research on the effects on classical music on places that are a bit rough around the edges.
    </p>
    <p>
        I was thinking of doing a pop up book but now that I think about it, I may do a 3D printed model of the station and a light show using LEDs.
