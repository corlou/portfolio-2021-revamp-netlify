        This week I got to know my class mates, discuss the course content, and pick our research topic for Week 3 Assignment. There is an ecclectic mix of people from around the world and with various backgrounds. It was nice to see other graphic designers who are also self-taught like myself and others who are also considering on the Diploma rather than the full masters. I very much look forward to branching out and exploring other other aspects of design.

        Here is a mindmap of everyone in my group for this week. As you can see, we have a fair amount in common such as Photoshop, InDesign, and Illustrator. However, that's where the commonalities end and we branch out into other areas of design.

        This trimester, I hope to explore other things. Last time in a class like this, I did apps and websites. This is of course, not a problem as this is what I want to do for a career btu now is the time for exploration and mistakes.

        The first assignmnet is a 10 minute presentation on a design topic randomly picked from the bowl. I got Steampunk! Yes! This is a fun topic and a design fashion movement. Something I have never done before. I'm excited to find other people who can work on this with me. I love the fashion, there is a band called Steampunk Giraffe, there is the film Wild Wild West... It's more than fashion; its a type of design culture.

    <h5>
        What is Design?
    </h5>
    <p>
        The creation, exploration, discovery of new experiences, methods, technologies, and movements. A way of thinking, planning, and developing the above concepts.
    </p>

        Design solves problems, so first and foremost; it is about people.
