        Our teacher Michelle was out sick today but we decided to meet at the library to get a solid start on our Assignment 1 presentation. Prince, Angus, and I are doing User Experience (UX). The history of it is pretty interesting and I learned a few things as well. We decided to do a poster as it the more difficult decision. Michelle said now is the time to experiment, test, fail, and try new things. So, I feel that the A0 poster is certaily a step out of my comfort zone.

        We looked at the assignment and what is required. It is a 10 minute presentation about UX. So, we thought of some important topics to cover such as
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Definition of UX = Prince</li>
        <li>What makes UX, UX? = Prince</li>
        <li>Why UX matters? = Angus</li>
        <li>History of UX= Angus</li>
        <li>What is the process of UX design? = Corina</li>
        <li>Good V.s Bad UX = Corina</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <p>
    We divided each topic and went off to do our research, sharing facts and videos of interest. I asked Prince if he was ok with designing the poster. He has a background in fine art and would have a good eye for aesthetics. Angus added his research to the Google Doc and he found some informative videos for us to watch. At the end of the session, we agreed to go away on our own and write up what each of us are going to say during the presentation. I have asked the guys to pass their words onto me so I can create the document for submission (need to make sure all of our references are included).
