    Hi there! I'm Corina. I like travelling, pole fitness, coffee, cats, and reading. Currently playing netball with my colleagues and attending Polish class in my spare time. I have recently taken up knitting and plan on spinning yarn. Fun and interesting fact: When we were travelling, I found a cat in every country and petted it.
