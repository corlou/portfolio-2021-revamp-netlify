Needed to make sure that local Hugo Version matched netlify.toml - Got the Netlify.toml information from "https://medium.com/backticks-tildes/hugo101-getting-started-with-hugo-and-deploying-to-netlify-9a813fe23b94" but their version was "0.54.0" and my local one is "0.80.0"

hugo server -D for localhost
